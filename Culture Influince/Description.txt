[b]REQUIRES BEYOND TYPUS IN ORDER TO WORK[/b]

This mod adds many new cultures and events to the game to model the influence a ruling empire would have had over it's subjects, similar to the Latin influence the Romans had over much of Europe (Italian, French, Spanish, Romanian, and to a certain extent English)

Consult images above for new cultures, will be expanded to cover more cultures in the future

[h1]Mechanics[/h1]
[list][*]Cultural standardization requires you to own all of the core cultures pertaining to the standard as well as being an empire (Hochdeutsch needs all germanic cultures except Dutch, Flemish, Prussian, and Austrian) (Francais requires all French cultures, except Walloon, and Arpitan)[/*]
[*]Assimilated cultures require you to accept the relevant cultures, and own 12-20 provinces with the relevant cultures. It will first spawn in a province with 15 development that either has 10 trade power or borders the standard culture it is assimilating into, the owner must also have instituted an administrative language (If none exist the culture will not appear) From there it will then spread outwards[/*]
[*]German settled cultures will appear in any province within the relevant region that borders a Germanic province or have been developed 5 times, and is not an accepted culture, the owner must also have the policy of Ostsiedlung. The speed of settlement increases greatly with a higher number of times improved.[/*]
[*]French re-education is enacted via decision, this will appear when the player has at least one province in the area of the specific culture and has standardised French, the decision can be taken once the player owns a key development centre in the area. The decision will cost ducats and begins the process of re-education, the new culture will spread outwards from the key development centre, re-education will require the player to take the decision several times in order to re-educate the whole area[/*]
[*]French settlement in Sardinia and Corsica works the same as German settled cultures, although the player does not need to enact the policy of Ostsiedlung.
[*]French settled cultures in North Africa work similarly to German settled cultures although the player does not need to enact the policy of Ostsiedlung. Taking key cities in North Africa will encourage more settlers speeding up the process of settlement. The key cities that encourage settlers are Cairo, Tunis and Marrakech[/*]
[*]French crusader cultures are unique to France and reflect their heavy involvement in the crusades. Crusader cultures spread in provinces of the correct religion as long as France remains Catholic. The speed is rapidly increased if France is papal controller, has religious ideas completed or is Defender of the Faith.[/*]
[*]If the player chooses to standardise French in the northern part of the country there will be some resistance to cultural shift by the previously Occitan residents of your empire. The Player can also choose to standardise French based on dialects spoken in the south of France creating the culture Occitan Larg, this comes with a whole host of events aimed at moving the development of the country from the north to the south.
[*]Gaelic and Brythonic will merge upon any Gaelic or Brythonic nation having 200 total develoment.[/*]
[*]Celtic settlement works the same as German settled cultures, although the player does not need to enact the policy of Ostsiedlung.[/*]
[*]Celtic nations in the Isles can form either Brythonaidd, or Goidhealach depending on their primary culture upon converting all of the isles to Celtic, this will then expand the culture to the size in the images above.[/*]
[*]Celtic nations in Gaul will unite the four cultures in Galianeg upon converting all of Gaul to Celtic[/*]
[*]British nations will have the option to devolve parliament upon converting all of Great Britain (Not Ireland!) to British and achieving Empire rank (Forming the UK will grant Empire level) you can either choose to unite the Isles into one culture slowly and centralize power, or Devolve power and keep the cultures seperate.[/*]
[*]England-France can unite the four French cultures into Anglo-French if they have centralized power[/*][/list]

[list][*]Idea totally stolen from Dub's [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1088606279]Byzantine Resurgence[/url][/*]
[*]Obviously [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=631545981]Beyond Typus[/url] and it's myriad of developers[/*]
[*]Large amount of the German localisation uses Argacyan's suggestions[/*][/list]
