 norraen_standardisation.desc:0 "It is has long been understood that if the Nordic peoples were able to unite their lands, they would be one of the strongest global powers. We have broken the Kalmar union and united Scandinavia under one political entity. This, and our growing power globally has allowed us to standardise our language. We are about to undertake the construction of the 'Senter for Nordiske Språk' which will allow us to continue the maintenance of our new unified dialect named Norræn, this will let us grow our influence and fulfil the goals of our Viking ancestors, to establish settlements all over Europe. We will also construct a few minor 'Senters' which will create jobs around Our Realm. Skål!"
