#CI overwrites autonyms for Alba and renames them to Welsh names to fit with the extended Brythonaidd Culture

#Alba (Taken from BtP)
248 = "Gododdin"			#Brythonic version
249 = "Aeron"			#Brythonic version, historical kingdom
250 = "Gwidd"			#Taken from CK2, no actual evidence, as far as I am aware, but 'sounds' good as an adapted Brythonic Fife
251 = "Cai"			#Taken from CK2. I don't know if there is any history here, but it 'sounds' good. Long live Arthur and his greatest knight! ;-)
252 = "Gwrturio"			#Taken from CK2, I'm not sure what the story is here, but seems to be a Cambrian adaptation of a Pictish name... I have no better ideas really, though.
253 = "Ynysoedd Allanol"			#Brythonic version
369 = "Ynys Orc"			#Brythonic version
1978 = "Ynys Cat"			#Brythonic version
3008 = "Rheged"			#Brythonic version, no one is actually sure where 'Rheged' was, exactly, or what its borders looked like, but this is as good a place as any. It has been suggested that 'Dunragit' comes from Dun Rheged, and Galloway is refered to in the Triads as one of the thrones of Britain, so it was likely a capital of sorts
4365 = "Manaw"			#Brythonic version
4110 = "Gwlad Cat"				#Brythonic version, perhaps not ideal, but going with it
4363 = "Ymyl Wyddelod"			#Brythonic version, Beyond Typus invention. (just a literal translation of the original name, which works okay here)
3019 = "Ystrad Clud"			#Brythonic version, town name Alt Clud
4362 = "Din Prys"			#Brythonic version
4361 = "Rhyd Eirian"			#Brythonic version, Beyond Typus invention, a translation of the origin of the capital name (an Geal Ath), which is itself a bit odd (adj-n instead of n-adj as would be expected. I may have to look into this more)
3137 = "Gwidaug"			#Taken from CK2 & slightly modified from old/middle Welsh to early modern/modern orthography. I couldn't actually find evidence for this name, but it 'sounds' alright
3138 = "Focla"			#Taken from CK2, I'm not sure what the story is here, but seems to be a Cambrian adaptation of a Pictish name... I have no better ideas really, though.
3139 = "Caer Cinn"			#Taken from CK2, actually really interesting history/idea here, so I'm using it.
4364 = "Ynysoedd Mewnol"			#Brythonic version
1979 = "Ynysow Faroe" #Faroes (Cornish name) CI extended up to Jan Mayen and the Faroes
5591 = "Dinas yr Iwerydd" #Jan Mayen (Welsh for Atlantic City)
