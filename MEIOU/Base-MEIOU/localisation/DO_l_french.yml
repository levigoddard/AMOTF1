 DO_introduction.001.t:1 "Développement amélioré de M&T !"
 DO_introduction.001.d:1 "Among the many changes that MEIOU and Taxes has made, it has also completely overhauled the game's development system.  Instead of development arising from the click of a button, the provinces of your country will grow based on the stresses, or successes, you subject them to.  Economies and populations grow now in game the same way they do in the real world.  If you put stress on your country, it will decrease the rate of development or even cause you to lose it.  Ruinous wars, plague, economic stagnation, and incompetent governance are examples of stress.  Success, on the other hand, improves the rate of development.  Peace, advancing technology, prudent government policies, robust international trade, and conquests achieved at low cost are all examples of success.  For more information on the development system, select the second option down below."
 DO_introduction.001.a:1 "Hmm... Pourrais-je simplement jouer au jeu, s'il-vous-plait ??"
 DO_introduction.001.b:1 "Dites m'en plus à propos de ce fascinant système de développement !"
 DO_introduction.002.t:1 "Ce qui se passe dans les coulisses"
 DO_introduction.002.d:1 "The new development system occurs in the background and responds automatically to your deeds in game.  Run your country into the ground during a ruinous war?  Your development will grind to a halt.  Achieve great wealth and affluence in your eastern trading companies?  Your provinces back home will grow like weeds.  Hundreds of factors are considered, and just about anything you do will either help or hurt your development growth.  Now, while all of the development is occurring behind the scenes so that the player isn't burdened by event pop ups, you CAN click a button in the decisions menu that will allow you to see what is happening behind the scenes.  However, because bigger countries tend to have more gross growth than smaller countries, it's not adviseable to leave the development events visible once your country gets beyond 40 provinces."
 DO_introduction.002.a:1 "D'accord. C'est parti !"
 DO_introduction.002.b:1 "Quelles mesures puis-je prendre pour améliorer le développement ?"
 DO_introduction.003.t:1 "Comment améliorer le développement et pourquoi ?"
 DO_introduction.003.d:1 "The best way to improve your development is not to hurt it.  War Exhaustion and suffering casualties during war will hurt your development.  So too will bankruptcy, enduring a disaster such as a civil war, and many other things.  Specific provinces can see precipitous declines in their development, too, if they are ravaged in war.  However, high stability, high prestige, and just about every other positive variable will improve your development rate.  Keep in mind, though, that development takes time.  It might take 300 years before you see the size of your provinces double, so be patient!  Aside from the obvious benefits of more income and more manpower, having a high development per province ratio will richly reward you with many different bonuses, while having low development will do the opposite, and cause your country to slowly decay from within.  With the new development system, a small, but highly developed country can stand toe to toe with a sparsely developed behemoth."

 DO_introduction.004.t:1 "Politiques de développement"
 DO_introduction.004.d:1 "While you, the ruler, cannot march off to a province like Paul Bunyan and singlehandedly improve its development by planting monarch points in farm fields, you CAN do what real rulers do: institute prudent policies to encourage growth.  The main mechanism for achieving this in M&T is development policies.  Development policies are unlocked by acquiring certain idea groups, just like normal policies.  Development policies often give you a slight development bonus, but most of them tend to focus on development IN PARTICULAR AREAS.  For instance, Pursuit of Knowledge gives extra development in provinces with Universities and schools, whereas Promote our Trade Centres will give extra development in and around centres of trade and major ports.  Some policies can even HURT development, but give you other rewards in return.  You can usually tell a development policy from a standard policy when you see the word DEVELOPMENT in the title.  If you would like details on each of the available development policies, you can click the second option down below or can click the Reveal Development Policies button in the decisions menu.  This requires that you already clicked the Reveal Events Button."

 DO_introduction.005.d:1 "Aside from keeping your country safe, secure, and prosperous, there are other ways to improve your country's development.  Policies are powerful tools to this end.  However, policies don't merely give you a flat bonus to development cost.  Many policies will also improve development in specific ways, so a prudent ruler should try to select policies which will play to his or her country's strengths.

 DO_westernization.0029.d:1 "In previous versions of Europa Universalis and M&T, it was necessary for your country to fall behind before it could westernise.  Now, there is a second way.  If you belong to a non-Western technology group, you can now achieve a Western tech group equivalent by excelling, rather than failing.  This method of achieving parity with the West, however, is NOT an easy task.  Because such a thing never happened in history, it requires a significant focus on development, prosperity, and education.  If you are successful toward this end, you will slowly gain Enlightenment Ranks.  Once the technology bonus from your Enlightenment Ranks match the negative bonus you get from your tech group, your tech group will flip to Western."
 DO_westernization.0029.a:1 "And what are the ways I might achieve this?"
 DO_westernization.0030.t:1 "How to nurture a non-Western Renaissance, Part II"
 DO_westernization.0030.d:1 "Achieving westernisation by this new means requires that your country thrive in numerous ways.  The most important way is to achieve a higher level of development and a high level of education.  The higher your development density and the higher your education percentage, the faster you will advance.  The size of your capital also plays a role in advancement since it is a centre of culture and learning, but it isn't quite as important as the prior two variables.  Also, certain idea groups will slightly accelerate the process, and these groups are culture, democracy, economic, engineering, humanist, innovativeness, and scholasticism.  The process will also be accelerated the more centralised and more secularised your country is.  Other minor variables that quicken the process are certain advisors, which include the philosopher, natural scientist, statesman, artist, architect, astronomer, naval reformer, and army reformer.  Also, the Promote Renaissance Policy will significantly accelerate the process."
 DO_westernization.0030.a:1 "What about negative influences?"
 DO_westernization.0031.t:1 "How to nurture a non-Western Renaissance, Part III"
 DO_westernization.0031.d:1 "While it is important that your nation thrive in order to advance during the non-Western Renaissance, it's also important not to fall behind in key areas.  Being decentralised hurts the process, as well as your country being under 15 provinces.  Also, falling behind in technology will have a significant negative effect, and may even halt your progress."
 DO_westernization.0031.a:1 "Any other pointers I need to know about?"
 DO_westernization.0032.t:1 "How to nurture a non-Western Renaissance, Part IV"
 DO_westernization.0032.d:1 "To succeed in this endeavour, especially if you are Muslim or Indian, you must play a very measured game.  Even if you are playing in a very deliberate way, it can take many generations to acquire the Western technology group.  Expanding aggressively and carelessly is a surefire way to fail, and should your development fall to Average, you will be unable to advance.  The best strategy is to expand slowly and deliberately while focusing on prosperity and wealth.  With enough wealth, you should be able to pursue development policies and an abundance of Universities, both of which play a very important role in succeeding."

 DO_building_census.003.d:1 "A country's building opportunity score is determined by the total base value of their country's buildings, divided by their number of provinces.  More expensive, more advanced buildings weigh more heavily on this calculus than inexpensive buildings.  Over time, if a country continues to construct buildings, they have fewer and fewer viable opportunities to construct additional buildings, and this is reflected by an increase in cost.  However, if a country conquers provinces that are poor in buildings, buildings will become cheaper because there are now more opportunities to build."
