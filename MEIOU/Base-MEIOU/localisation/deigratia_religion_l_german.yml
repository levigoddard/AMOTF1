Although lieges could prevent their land from being donated, many independent estates were lost to the crown in this manner, and in some countries the church owned more than a third of all land!"

Some rulers transformed these properties into money to pay for wars or building projects by selling the lands off, while others doled them out to nobles in order to shore up their rule and stabilize the nation during times of turmoil.  Still others saw it as an opportunity to increase the power of the state by turning them into state property.

Worse, in most countries, chuch land was not taxed, diverting a large part of the country's riches away from the state coffers.  More than one ruler looked at the wealth and land of the church with greed in his eyes, but seizing it was easier said than done.  With power both spiritual and temporal, it was unwise to cross the church openly.  Rulers could, and did, attempt to seize church land, often by phrasing it as a request to the church in order to use the funds to fight a desperate holy war.  In times of great hardship, the church might just give in - or be forced to."

 royal_schools_desc:1 "Since the middle ages, strong nobles kept the children of their rivals, educating them at court along with their own children in order to build future alliances and hold a hostage to ensure their parents good behaviour.  In later centuries, powerful rulers turned this practice into a system in which the sons of the most powerful families would be taught in a school alongside the heir to the throne.  This would encourage friendships among the future movers and shakers of the nation as well as allow for the best tutors to be brought together to teach history, strategy and the art of statecraft."

In order for aristocrats to succeed at court, they now needed to be skilled in a number of areas, from horsemanship to manners, mathematics to poetry, history to music.  Before attending university, the children of the nobility could be sent to boarding schools meant to prepare them for their future careers.  Such preparatory schools were also open to the sons of the bourgeoisie, and this spread literacy and allowed some social mobility."

Eventually, a system of compulsory education for all children was proposed, giving them some basic literacy and math and providing them with the skills needed to seek a trade.  This had the effect of allowing the state to dictate morality to the population, encouraging the growth of nationalism."

Worse yet, they could often call upon support from the population.  To avoid this challenge to their authority, rulers could legally establish themselves as the head of the state church, giving them the same powers as the leader of a religious order.  This would give them the authority to appoint religious leaders they preferred, seize church land, and be the final arbiter in issues of doctrine or law.  This was an extremely unpopular decision with the church, but in most cases, they had little choice but to accept the new reality."
 church_taxes_title:1 "Tax church property"
 church_taxes_desc:1 "By long tradition, the state supported the church by not taxing it.  As modern tax codes developed, this exception was increasingly obvious to rulers who noted how much of the nation's land was owned directly by the church without actually being houses of worship.  Clergy increasingly ran farms, businesses, or even acted as landlords of tenant farmers, all without paying taxes to the state.  By removing this exception, we can increase the coffers of the state without raising taxes on the peasants or risking a revolt from the aristocracy.  However, it will harm the church's finances, and this may cut back on their missionary and charitable work."
 state_supported_church_title:1 "Support the church financially"
 state_supported_church_desc:1 "With the ruler the head of the church, it was only a small step towards the idea that the church should be an arm of the government.  Some among our advisors suggest that we should take that step and mandate a tithe on all our subjects which would be paid to the government, which in turn would pay the salaries of clergy, funding for charitable causes, and the upkeep of religious buildings across the nation.  This would strengthen the ability of the government to fight heresy, but would require a regular budget."

In response to this, the government could require all members of the clergy to swear an oath of loyalty - not to their god or their church, but to the state.  This would not only reduce the likelihood of them criticizing the government, it would also give the ruler a legal right to remove them from office when they did so.  However, it would be extremely unpopular with the clergy, let alone foreign religious leaders."

Some of them founded monasteries and other settlements in areas that were far from settled areas.  In the process, they built farms, homes and schools, and so encouraged peasants to move nearby.  In so doing, they opened up new areas to habitation, increasing the prosperity of the whole nation."
 religious_advisors:1 "Religious Advisors"
 religious_advisors_desc:1 "Our secular leaders are advised by religious leaders in their pay.  By maintaining a position of responsibility at court, nobles effectively created a network of neutral communication between themselves and their neighbours.  When a crisis threatened war, court chaplains could act as neutral negotiators to defuse the situation."
 fraternities:1 "Fraternities"
 fraternities_desc:1 "Religious Fraternities were founded by craftsmen who wanted to share both their faith and the risks of their lives and professions.  The fraternity would engage in religious ceremonies in their community, but it would also collect a tithe from members that would help widows and orphans from their membership."
 theology_ideas:1 "State Religion"
 holy_orders:1 "Holy Orders"
 holy_orders_desc:1 "Our faith encourages warriors to fight for their faith by joining a holy order.  These holy warriors were professional soldiers whose livelihoods were providied by church land and donations from the faithful, rather than from our nation's coffers.  They made up a small but important part of the army."
 popular_religion:1 "Popular Religion"
 popular_religion_desc:1 "There is a difference between a religion that is observed by the population and a religion that is celebrated by them.  Our nation has developed a rich culture of religious entertainment, from music to festivals, which encourages even the most skeptical subjects to include religion in their lives."
 educated_priests:1 "Educated priests"
 educated_priests_desc:1 "As some of the most highly educated members of society who also had the chance to spend their lives in seclusion, priests had a nearly unique role in society.  While maintaining their faith, they could take on the roles of traveller, author, artist, scientist, or diplomat.  Many of the discoveries of the early modern era were brought to light thanks to the efforts of dedicated priests."
 religious_traditions:1 "Religious Traditions"

 mandatory_church_attendance:1 "Mandatory Church Attendance"
 mandatory_church_attendance_desc:1 "In a time before high speed communication, the church was a powerful tool for rulers to spread messages to their people.  However, this only works when the people attend church!  By legislating this duty as a law, we will ensure that the populace hears our words while they attend services."
 devotion:1 "Devotion"
 devotion_desc:1 "Our nation enjoys a long tradition of piety.  People from high to low are encouraged to take religious oaths, go on pilgrimages, donate to good works, and join holy orders.  The effects of this across our nation are widespread."
 interfaith_dialogue:1 "Interfaith Dialogue"
 interfaith_dialogue_desc:1 "Having had to deal with competing orders and sects in the past, our religious leaders have become adept at smoothing over theological differences rather than fighting over them.  In this manner, we avoid schism and heresy while allowing for differences."
 DEI_GRATIA_SUGGESTIONS:1 "Dei Gratia Suggested Countries"
 DEI_GRATIA_SUGGESTIONS_DESC:1 "Dei Gratia does not treat every religion equally; some get more events than others, due to history, geography or inspiration.

 monastic_diversity_desc:1 "By having a wide variety of religious orders, ascetics can choose to join an order that specializes in an area of interest to them.  Some choose to preach to unbelievers, others to produce wine and cheese, others to become teachers.  In so doing they manage to gather highly educated people together for the common good."
 holy_warriors:1 "Holy Warriors"
 holy_warriors_desc:1 "To fight for one's faith is the highest calling a warrior can assume.  This means that many seek to join the ranks of the army and fight against unbelievers."
 augury:1 "Augury"
 augury_desc:1 "Our priests claim to be able to foretell the future in a variety of ways, from analyzing scripture to reading omens.  The people rely on this to make plans - where to settle, when to fight a battle, even who to marry.  By having these signs to follow, the people are more content."
 monuments:1 "Monuments"
 monuments_desc:1 "Our faith is displayed not only by priests and temples, but also by sacred monuments built purely to celebrate our religion.  These serve as a constant reminder of the power and mystery of the divine."
 sacrifices:1 "Sacrifices"
 sacrifices_desc:1 "There is a common belief among the people that, when bad things happen to us, it is God's anger.  It stands to reason that by mollifying God, we can turn his anger away from us.  This takes the form of public sacrifices by priests and rulers.  The people, knowing that this will mollify God, go away in a cheerful mood from these events."
 grand_ceremony:1 "Grand Ceremony"
 grand_ceremony_desc:1 "There is a ceremony for everything, from marriage to funerals, from planting crops to declaring war.  Our priests spend much of their time conducting these ceremonies, and only they know all the intricacies of them.  This makes them indispensable to the smooth functioning of our religion and our country."
 prophecy:1 "Prophecy"

 reliquaries:1 "Reliquaries"
 reliquaries_desc:1 "There is a widespread belief that objects owned by or part of a holy person remain holy after their death.  For this reason, temples and religious orders maintain such relics as part of their mysteries, to encourage worship and pilgrimage.  At times they have even fought over them!  This also allows rulers to amass holy relics as part of their regalia."
 faith_healing:1 "Faith Healing"
 faith_healing_desc:1 "Priests are capable of calling upon God for blessings.  For some of the faithful, this can heal afflictions and bring balms to the suffering.  As a result, the people flock to such faith healers for all sorts of problems real and imagined."
 evangelism:1 "Evangelism"
 evangelism_desc:1 "Not only priests, but the laity reach out to unbelievers, seeking to convert their fellows to the one true faith.  While this does not always win them friends, it acts as a powerful army of missionaries!"
 flexible_theology:1 "Flexible Theology"
 flexible_theology_desc:1 "Our faith is a flexible one, willing to embrace local myths and legends as part of its canon.  This allows our priests to incorporate the beliefs of others into the true faith, making it easier to convert them to this more familiar foreign faith."
 messiahs:1 "Messiahs"
 messiahs_desc:1 "Charismatic priests can build up large groups of followers far out of proportion to their rank within the church.  This allows the cream to rise to the top: religious leaders that the people will follow emerge to fight against invaders."

By granting them relative freedom and privilege, we are encouraging their numbers and giving us their support.  However, at the same time we are upsetting the order of things in the area as well as the more pious members of our state religion."
 scriptural_tradition_desc:1 "Our faith has a scriptural tradition dating back many centuries.  The sayings of scholars and saints through the ages has been collected and codified and has become part of an evolving understanding of our religion."
 religious_law_desc:1 "By using scripture as well as the precedents made by past religious authorities, we can point to definitive laws to help govern our nation.  This gives us an advantage over countries that have a hodge-podge of local laws that vary from place to place and culture to culture."
 itinerant_preachers_desc:1 "There is a long-standing tradition of members of the clergy adopting vows of poverty and travelling far and wide preaching to the public.  This provides us with an army of volunteer missionaries."
 clerical_teaching_desc:1 "To deal with volumes of law and scripture, our priests have set up schools and universities to train their fellows in law, theology and even medicine."
 ecceleistical_judiciary_desc:1 "Having a highly literate clergy who are trained to practice a divine code of laws gives us a ready-made justice system that can replace the authority of local nobles with a single, unified set of laws for the entire nation.  While it can resist a ruler's authority, it helps to tip power away from the aristocracy and reduces arbitrary or evil misuses of justice."

 dg_church_influence.021.t:1 "Decaying temples"
 dg_church_influence.021.d:1 "A pale shadow of its former self, the $COUNTRY_RELIGION$ faith finds itself in financial straits.  Forced to rely largely on the voluntary donations of worshippers, it was inevitable that some temples would fall into disrepair or even be abandoned completely.  Usually this was a minor inconvenience, requiring villages to hire an itinerant preacher to travel there several times a year for important rituals, but occasionally it was a national embarassment when an ancient or beautiful place had to be shut to the public.  Knowing this, a savvy church leader could force the $MONARCHTITLE$ into choosing between state support for the church and appearing to be uncaring."

Along such routes, inns and shrines would appear to cater to travellers from afar, and in so doing, could become hubs of trade.

 dg_help.014.d:1 "Every country has a §Gpiety§! rating, which determines how enthusiastic the population is about religion.  You can see your country's piety rating by checking your country modifiers.  \n\nPiety is rated from +100 (fanatical) to -100 (secular).  The higher your piety, the more religious events you will receive, and the stronger their effects will be, both good and bad.  In addition, pious countries gain bonuses to §Gtolerance of the state religion§!, §Glegitimacy§! and §Gmorale§!.  However, pious countries also suffer a small penalty to §Rtolerance of other religions§!.  On the other hand, the lower your piety, the fewer religious events you will receive, and the weaker their effects will be.  Secular countries gain bonuses to §Gtolerance of other religions§!, §Gtechnology cost§! and §Greligious unity§!, but suffer a small penalty to §Rtolerance of the state religion§!.  \n\nA country's piety can change according to circumstances, but usually only gradually.  Piety is calculated behind the scenes two to three times a year.  The single biggest component is §Bnational ideas§!.  Each religious national idea increases a player's piety by 5%.  In addition, several ideas can reduce piety by 10% each: four innovative ideas, three plutocratic ideas, Nationalistic Enthusiasm and Revolution and Counter Revolution.  Another major source of piety is your §Bgovernment§!: theocracies have +20% piety, tribal governments have +10%, and republics have -10%.  In addition, earlier forms of government such as feudal or despotic have +10% piety, while more advanced kinds like constitutional or enlightened have -10%.  Your piety can also be affected by your §Beducation system§!, which is determined by the decisions you take and your administrative technology.  Finally, your country's §Bcircumstances§! will affect piety; being at war with a religious enemy raises it, allying with one lowers it, being defender of the faith raises it, as does bordering a heathen country.  There are many other modifiers that can affect piety, but most will be shown in the effect of events and decisions.  In the end, use your common sense!"
 dg_help.015.d:1 "Every country has a §Gchurch influence§! rating, which reflects how strong and independent the state church is in your country.  Most countries can see their country's church influence on the religion screen, except for Catholics who see the papacy instead (sorry).  \n\nChurch Influence is rated from 0 (none) to 100 (total).  The higher your church influence, the stronger the church becomes.  The higher your church influence, the more §Gmissionaries§! you will receive, the stronger those missionaries will be, and the lower your §Grevolt risk§! will be in provinces with the state religion.  On the other hand, your §Radministrative tech costs§! and §Rstability costs§! will be higher, and you will receive much less §Rtax income§! from provinces with the state religion.\n\nLike piety, church influence usually changes gradually.  It is calculated behind the scenes two to three times a year, and comes from three major sources: §BChurch Property§! is worth up to 60% influence, representing land owned by the church.  Giving land to the church or paying them money will increase this amount, while seizing or taxing it will lower it.  §BChurch Authority§! is worth as much as 40%, but is usually much less.  This represents the legal power of the church, and comes from having representatives in government (such as advisors), from having independent judiciaries, and from having a theocratic form of government.  Hiring theologians or inquisitors will raise it, while enforcing secular courts will lower it.  Finally, §BChurch Appeal§! is worth up to 20% and represents the church's support from the population.  This could come from control over the education system or from monasticism."

 dg_help.031.t:1 "Converting your own country"
 dg_help.031.d:1 "With dozens of religions in the game, it is important to understand how and why you can convert.  Most religions do not allow their ruler to convert the country, but there are exceptions.  Hindus may convert to Jainism and vice versa, Buddhists may convert freely between their denominations, Sunni and Wahhabi Muslims may convert, and the five western Christian denominations (Catholics, Protestants, Reformed Christians, Calixtines and Gnostic Christians) can convert between each other.  \n\nYou may only convert once per ruler, and not under certain circumstances.  In addition, the stability cost of converting depends on the circumstances: owning provinces of the desired religion, having a theologian advisor, and having a strong ruler will all make it easier.  \n\nIn some cases, you may not be able to convert this way until a religion is enabled by event (for example, it will take several years after the Reformed religion appears before a ruler would willingly convert to it), or you may never be able to convert this way (it is impossible for an Orthodox country to convert to Catholic by this method).  In those cases, there are events that can allow a country to convert its religion.  For example, Orthodox countries can convert to Catholic once, by decision during a church council.  Countries in India may be able to convert to Sikhism by event when it appears.  Pagans will receive missionaries that may ask them to convert to the religion of nearby nations.  A vassal's overlord can sometimes ask for it's conversion.  However, these events are rare.  \n\nOne final way to convert your religion is by suffering religious rebels.  If you have a high tolerance for a religion, then rebels of that religion can force you to convert to it.  If you try to force a religion to convert and it starts a War of Religion, you may choose which religion to support, and in so doing, your state religion."

During a war, you may be able to ask the other country to convert, but only if it would normally be able to do so voluntarily.  In other words, you could force a Catholic country to become Protestant, but not Orthodox.  If you convert religion, your vassals who belong to your old religion will be asked to convert as well.  You may also demand that a vassal convert to your religion if its capital belongs to your religion - which can be helped along by a decision §Rnot in this version§! to send missionaries.  Finally, you will be told about wars of religion in other countries if you have chosen to receive religious news.  By intervening on one side, you will control the outcome - and the religion of the country."
 dg_help.033.a:1 "Tell me more about minorities"
 dg_help.023.a:1 "Tell me about these minority events"
 dg_help.023.d:1 "Several interesting religions in the game like Jews or Jains appear only as religious minorities.  For some players, an interesting goal would be to help revive these religions and then play as a country of that faith.  But how?  Religious minorities do not grow or shrink on their own.  Instead, you will occasionally have the chance to encourage them to grow by event.  When a §Bminority event§! happens, the option that is most tolerant towards the minority will usually cause the religion to grow in one province.  You may also attract a religious minority to a province by declaring it a §Bhaven§! for that religion by decision, or by favoring a heathen minority over other heathens."
 dg_help.024.d:1 "Religious minorities in your country also give you access to 4 random events. These events can be used to deliberately increase the population of a minority in your country, if you are so inclined; in every case, tolerating the minority means they will grow by 1 in one province. In some cases, your choices may also prevent you from expelling those minorities for 5-10 years afterwards (because your ruler finds them convenient to have around).  \n\nThe §BGifted§! event gives you the option of accepting an advisor or general from that religion.\nThe §BTemple§! event asks you to approve building of a new church, mosque or temple for that minority in a province. You may choose to allow it, deny them, or demand payment for the right.\nThe §BContacts§! event lets you use a minority in your empire which is also found in a center of trade you are trading in, allowing you to gain a small trade advantage there.  Note, however, that some religions are far more likely to be found in centers of trade than others!\nThe §BScapegoats§! event fires when countries are at low stability. It allows countries to blame their problems on a minority of the same culture, regaining stability at the cost of some revolt risk."
 dg_help.012.d:1 "Some parts of the world that were home to many competing faiths, such as India, Persia, and the Near East, were divided between religions.  Zoroastrians fled to India to escape persecution in India.  Pockets of Jews lived in ghettos in Europe, Buddhism was fading from India, and Sunni Muslims were making inroads in Indonesia.  All of this can be represented in the game using the religious minority system.\n\nIn Dei Gratia, §Bevery province is divided into 21 populations which each have a religion§!.  The mod checks each province's populations two to three times a year and decides which religion it should be.  Other religions in the province are represented as modifiers whose effects depend on §Bhow much your country tolerates that religion§!.  Having a Catholic minority in a province is great when you're Catholic, but not as nice when you're a Protestant, and a real pain when you're a Hindu.  \n\nThe smallest possible minority modifier is a population of 2 (10% of the population).  Below that, populations are counted but have no game effects."
 dg_help.022.d:1 "Unfortunately you cannot send a missionary to a province that already has your state religion.  Instead, countries get access to two decisions that allow them to get rid of minorities.\n\nThe §Bpeaceful conversion§! decision allows you to convert a minority in one province.  It automatically chooses the province with the largest possible minority to convert, and automatically succeeds, although it takes some time.  However, peaceful conversion only reduces the population by 10% (heathen minorities) to 20% (heretic minorities).  Because of this, it is not always practical for large empires.\n\nThe §Bforced conversion§! decision allows you to reduce a minority by 10% throughout your empire.  This is a much more dangerous decision; a minority that is widespread enough will resist this decree with an uprising or even a civil war!  The larger the minority is compared to your state religion, the worse the results will be.  \n\nIn both cases, some of your minority will convert to your state religion, and others will choose to pack up and leave, becoming refugees that will seek a home elsewhere."
 dg_help.033.d:1 "When a missionary succeeds in converting a province, it does not always stay converted.  Why?  Because missionaries in Dei Gratia can only convert a fraction of the population.  \n\n Just as every country has a state religion but may own provinces of many religions, each province has a religion on the map, but may have populations belonging to several faiths.  In Dei Gratia, every province is divided into 21 populations which each have a religion.  The mod checks each province's populations two to three times a year to decide which religion to assign to it.  \n\nWhen a missionary succeeds in a province, it converts the province to the state religion, which is a signal to the mod that up to 20% of the heathens and 20% of the heretics in that province will convert to your state religion.  Sometimes this is enough to convert a province with one missionary - if you had a minority there already, or if the province was divided between many religions.  Sometimes it may take two or even three missionaries before the province converts for good.  \n\nThese early missionaries are not wasted.  Every time a missionary succeeds, your religion grows in that province (check the minority modifiers!).  In addition, you will be rewarded with prestige (and papal influence for Catholics) every time a missionary succeeds, whether or not it is 'final'.\n\nWhen your religion is the single biggest faith in the province, the province will stay your religion - but be aware that this often leaves behind minorities of other faiths.  These minorities may be a thorn in your side - or they may be safely ignored.  Which is true will depend on your tolerance and your strategy."

Execution is the time honored punishment for treason, but there are reasons to consider alternative solutions.  Unlike many rebels, religious rebels had widespread support from their communities, so simply executing one charismatic leader might not quell revolts from the same community.  As a result, some rulers punished all supporters of a heresy when a rebellion broke out, or drove them out of the country entirely.  Others considered ways to turn a liability into a strength by rethinking state policies and winning the support of heretics."

The death blow came from the Muslim invasions that wiped out Buddhist temples in the north - yet what if Buddhism had been able to compete against Hindus and survive to meet the Muslims?\n\nAs Buddhism spread out of India into the rest of Asia, it was adopted by the Japanese, who found in it an organized religion that was lacking in the traditional folk religion of Shintô.  The Shintô priests were unable to put up a fight against the new religion, and instead it was largely subsumed into Buddhist mythology.  What if the Japanese had fought off this foreign faith?\n\nThe Sikhs began as a fifteenth and sixteenth century reaction to the religious violence in India as it was torn between Muslims and Hindus.  Yet the history of India is full of Muslim invasion and religious violence.  What if the Guru had spread his ideas when Mahmud of Ghazni invaded India in the eleventh century instead?"

 dg_piety.013.d:1 "In the early modern era, few occupations had the opportunity to think and read all day.  The life of a priest or monk was an exception to that rule.  Not only did it allow literacy and an education in the classics, but it even encouraged a life of solitude in many cases.  This was fertile soil to grow scientists, and many famous scientists devoted themselves to God first, but science second.  Gregor Mendel, Roger Bacon, Francesco Grimaldi, and dozens of other monks and priests expanded Man's knowledge of mathematics, astronomy, botany, physics, medicine, and other areas of science in the early modern era.  Now we can add the name of $THEOLOGIAN$ to that list.  For the most part, the reaction of the church to these cleric scientists was positive, but there were always those who regarded such men as a perversion of holy orders - clerics who had taken vows to devote themselves to the divine should not be studying worldy things."

These refugees included skilled workers and merchants who had more to lose by staying and more opportunities to leave, and they helped to spread new ideas and technologies.  Many were happy to pay taxes and serve in the army as long as they could find a safe refuge for their families.  \n\nRefugees were also foreigners who spoke different languages and practiced a different way of life.  Even when their religious practices were similar to their hosts, it caused friction as they integrated into a new culture.  Some rulers were tolerant of refugees and others actively courted them, hoping to increase their wealth and influence along with their population.  Many, however, closed their doors to them, or simply chased them out of their lands altogether."
