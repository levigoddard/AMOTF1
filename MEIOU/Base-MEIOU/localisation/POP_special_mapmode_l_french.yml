 POP_special_MAPMODE.110.d: "This mapmode allows the player to see provincial farming efficiency.  Farming Efficiency determines how much extra food each rural population is making.  For instance, a farming efficiency of 30% allows 1 rural pop to create enough food for 0.3 city dwellers or 0.3 rural dwellers making rural goods.  All excess food is shared at the regional level."

Good weather generates better crop yields and thus better nutrition, which improves population growth and reduces the risk of famine.  Bad weather generates worse crop yields and worse nutrition, resulting in higher famine risk.  Province Trauma and bad weather can both conspire to create an even greater risk of famine."

These menu options allow the player to show how much of the region's excess food has already been consumed, and how much remains unconsumed.  Regions which have low excess food are in fact symptomatic of regions which are highly mature and enjoyed historical peace, whereas regions with high excess food are typically symptomatic of regions which have had most of their cities and rural industries destroyed."

 POP_special_MAPMODE.230.d: "This mapmode allows the player to a general map of rural production power.  Rural Production power determines how many rural goods are being made in a province.

Rural industries take damage when there is famine and war which removes maturity, and the extent to which they rebound depends on how much excess food is in the region.  Provinces which have enjoyed long periods of peace enjoy more mature industries, and mature industries generate more rural wealth than immature industries, which generate more goods."

 POP_special_MAPMODE.310.d: "This mapmode allows the player to see a region's urbanisation percentage.  The more urbanised a region is, the more city dwellers it has relative to rural population.  Highly urbanised regions tend to be highly affluent, but also highly vulnerable to disruption.  Usually, high urbanisation is either supported by robust farming efficiency in a region or via food imports, though it is usually the former."

When there is a large urban population relative to a small urban gravity value, fewer people move to the city.  Conversely, when there is a small urban population relative to a large gravity, more people move to the city.  Another way to look at it is that Urban Saturation represents the amount of opportunity that exists in a city.  If a plague or an enemy army comes and kills a significant amount of population in a city, the Urban Saturation becomes significantly lower, since there are now many jobs vacated by the people that were there before."

There are three tiers of urban goods, and the higher your city's skill, the more access that city has to those superior tiers of goods.  25 skill is needed to make a Tier 2 good, and 75 skill is needed to make a Tier 3 good.  Centres of production generate skill over time, and without a centre of production, a city's skill will diminish down to 25.  Centres of production distribute their skill to other provinces in the subcontinent, and once a city has 150 skill, that rate of transmission doubles."

While you can take many, many measures to increase population and 'modify' Innate Fertility throughout the game to increase a province's population capacity, Innate Fertility is the ultimate anchor.  If a province's population is artificially below its Innate Fertility, rural population growth rate will be driven up faster.  If a province's population is artificially above its Innate Fertility, rural population growth rates will be driven down."

 POP_special_MAPMODE.600.t: "Tribal Settlement"
 POP_special_MAPMODE.600.d: "From here you can show Settlement Gravity and Tribal Population from the trade mapmode. Tribes settle over time based on many factors, including terrain, the influence of nearby settled populations, trade, local urban population, the presence of legalistic structures and pressure from centralised states. The Settlement Gravity of a province represents these factors, and their exponential pull on the tribal population. Negative gravity will lead to a larger tribal population, while positive gravity will encourage tribes to settle down and integrate. The more settled a tribal province is, the more it invests in its agricultural economy at the expense of its tribal host."
