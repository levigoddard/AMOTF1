 western_halberd_infantry:1 "Halberdiere"
 western_halberd_infantryDESCR:1 "Hellebarden waren eine Stangenwaffe, die eine Spitze und eine axtgleiche Schneide besaß um mehr Möglichkeiten im Kampf gegen schwere Infanterie zu bieten.  Sie kamen im 14. und 15. Jahrhundert in Mode."
 western_spearman_infantry:1 "Speerträger"
 western_spearman_infantryDESCR:1 "Am Anfang des 14. Jahrhunderts begann die Infanterie sich Kavallerietaktiken anzupassen und in kurvigen Formationen zu kämpfen, in der ein Schildwall die Speerträger schützte, die den Feind von den Armbrustschützen wegzuhalten."
 western_knight_cavalry:1 "Gepanzerte Ritter"
 western_knight_cavalryDESCR:1 "Für hunderte von Jahren beherrschten gepanzerte Ritter die Schlachtfelder Europas.  Diese stark gerüsteten Adeligen, trainiert in der Kunst des Krieges und von Knappen und Dienern unterstützt, stürmten in die feindliche Infanterie.  Diese Anstürme führten bei leichter Infanterie in der Regel zu Panik und die Formation lösste sich schnell auf."
 western_raid_cavalry:1 "Überfallkavallerie"
 western_raid_cavalryDESCR:1 "Während der Zeit der Pest entwickelt, als es zu wenig Rekruten gab, wurde Überfallkavallerie benutzt um den Feind zu schwächen und ihn in eine für sich selber vorteilhafte Konfrontation zu locken.  Nur leicht bewaffnet und gepanzert, griff die Überfallkavallerie Farmen, Dörfer und Versorgungstrecks an, lenkten feindliche Soldaten ab, nahmen Geiseln, stahlen Vorräte und verursachten Unruhen.  Die Franzosen nannten die Überfallkavallerie im Hundertjährigen Krieg Chevauchee, die Schotten Reiver, wenn sie gegen die Engländer kämpften, und die Spanieer Cavalgada, wenn sie die Muslime überfielen.  Obwohl sie wichtig für die Kriegsführung waren, waren sie in der Schlacht selber nicht so wirkungsvoll."
 western_hobelar_cavalry:1 "Hobelarkavallerie"
 western_hobelar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Developed in order to fight in the dense woods and bogs of Ireland, Hobelar cavalry were light cavalrymen who wore hauberks and fought with swords and lances.  This allowed them to travel fast and maneuver quickly, which gave the Hobelars an edge in reconnaisance and scouting missions.  They took their name from the hobby horses they rode, a kind of fast, agile horse."
 western_runner_cavalry:1 "Rennerkavallerie"
 western_runner_cavalryDESCR:1 "The use of longbows that could punch through armor gave infantry the upper hand in the fourteenth century.  This spurred an arms race in which elite heavy cavalry known as Reinier or Panzerati wore increasingly heavy armor designed to protect them from arrows.  The tactics remained the same, but the heavier plate mail returned control of the battlefield to the horseman."
 western_mountedarcher_cavalry:1 "Berittene Bogenschützen"
 western_mountedarcher_cavalryDESCR:1 "With the proven effectiveness of the bow in battle, armies in Western Europe began to replace light hobelar with mounted archers who could act as raiders and scouts as well as harass the enemy from afar.  Although not as effective as longbowmen, mounted archers could be deadly in large numbers and were able to react quickly to exploit weaknesses and withdraw from battle when necessary.  They proved their worth at the battle of Crecy, when English mounted archers turned back a French charge."
 western_freecompany_infantry:1 "Freie Kompanien"
 western_freecompany_infantryDESCR:1 "The predominance of conscript footsoldiers in medieval armies, and the expense of maintaining armored knights, led to the emergence of mercenaries who were highly trained and well-armed infantry.  Their heavy armor gave them an edge over regular armies, and free companies such as the Condotta of Italy achieved predominance on the battlefield.  However, free companies fought for themselves first, their employers second.  Their tactics were designed to minimize their own losses, not fight to the death in a losing cause."
 western_longbow_infantry:1 "Langbogenschützen"
 western_longbow_infantryDESCR:1 "Bows have been in use for thousands of years.  Larger bows, such as the English Longbow, had longer range and more power, allowing them to penetrate the heavy armor worn by knights on the battlefield.  They had a high rate of fire and were accurate over long distances, making them especially useful in war.  However, longbows demanded intensive training in order to use them effectively, making it difficult to raise large armies.  In the end, they disappeared from the battlefield not because they were obsolete, but because it was cheaper and easier to train peasants to use firearms."
 western_manatarms_infantry:1 "Waffenknechte"
 western_manatarms_infantryDESCR:1 "The feudal system encouraged knights to raise private armies of men at arms to support them in combat.  These professional soldiers made up the gentry, a class below the aristocracy but above the working classes.  In combat, they fought on foot, heavily armed and armored, but working in small units for their lords rather than in large regiments."
 western_lance_infantry:1 "Lanzeninfanterie"
 western_lance_infantryDESCR:1 "Knights and Men-at-Arms were effective soldiers but not effective armies.  Although highly trained and heavily armored, they fought in small units and their tactics and arms varied immensely.  During the fourteenth century, some countries began to try and regulate them, placing them into larger units and standardizing their weaponry and tactics.  By the end of the Hundred Years War, the French had developed a standard unit consisting of 'lances' that each contained men-at-arms, archers and supporting footsoldiers, allowing them to work and fight together with more discipline."
 western_gendarme_cavalry:1 "Gendarmekavallerie"
 western_gendarme_cavalryDESCR:1 "Knights and Men-at-Arms were effective soldiers but not effective armies.  Although highly trained and heavily armored, they fought in small units and their tactics and arms varied immensely.  During the fourteenth century, some countries began to try and regulate them, placing them into larger units and standardizing their weaponry and tactics.  By the end of the Hundred Years War, the French had developed a professional class of 'Gendarmes', armored cavalry who were not nobles and so were willing to take orders and fight in large units."
 western_pike_infantry:1 "Pikeniere"
 western_pike_infantryDESCR:1 "The dominance of heavy cavalry on the battlefield led some countries to reintroduce the tactics of ancient Greece by introducing light infantry who fought mainly with long spears or pikes in tight squares.  These square formations could stop a cavalry charge cold and returned control of the battlefield to infantry, who adapted the pike in the Renaissance to allow for aggressive attacks - but it relied on discipline, confidence and coordination, making it vital to have professional soldiers instead of badly-trained conscripts.  Unfortunately, the same design that made it so effective against cavalry - densely-packed squares of spearmen - also made it extremely vulnerable to musket fire."
 western_charge_infantry:1 "Sturminfanterie"
 western_charge_infantryDESCR:1 "Unable to fight open field battles against the English, the Scottish developed Galloglaigh infantry, armored soldiers who would use cover to launch ambushes against the enemy, charging forward at close range to enemy lines.  This tactic worked well in close quarters, but was less effective in open warfare."
 western_pikeandshot_infantry:1 "Piken und Schützen"
 western_pikeandshot_infantryDESCR:1 "Early firearms were slow and inaccurate, making them impractical on the battlefield.  However, if protected by a screen of pikemen, they could reload in peace and attack enemies who stayed out of range of the pikes.  Using these 'pike and shot' tactics, heavily outnumbered Spanish forces were able to rout French forces during the Italian Wars - and in so doing, secured the place of this formation for decades."
 western_wheellock_infantry:1 "Radschlossinfanterie"
 western_wheellock_infantryDESCR:1 "Early arquebuses were matchlocks that relied on a slowly-burning fuse to fire the gun, making it nearly useless in wet weather and unreliable the rest of the time. By the early sixteenth century, a new wheellock mechanism was developed which used a rotating steel wheel to ignite the gunpowder.  This made arquebuses much more reliable than before as well as easier to conceal in battle (there was no tell-tale glow or smoke before the shot was fired), which also made them more dangerous: many countries banned the wheellock entirely for this reason.  It did not help that the wheellock mechanism was complex, making the guns too expensive to be used as cheap infantry."
 western_freeshooter_infantry:1 "Freischützeninfanterie"
 western_freeshooter_infantryDESCR:1 "As guns became deadlier and more common on battlefields, charge infantry changed tactics. They were still trained and equipped to fight up-close, but they deliberately waited for the enemy to shoot before charging. Because guns could take so long to reload, they could often close the distance before the enemy had a chance to fire twice, and both arquebuses and muskets were notoriously inaccurate at longer ranges. This strategy was risky but paid off handsomely when it succeeded."
 western_earlytercio_infantry:1 "Frühe Tercioinfanterie"
 western_earlytercio_infantryDESCR:1 "The Spanish developed a formation that was made up of one-third arquebusiers, one third pikemen, and one third swordsmen, all trained soldiers.  The result was a unit that could fight any kind of enemy on the battlefield, defending itself from cavalry charges or regular troops while still firing on the enemy.  The result was so effective that it became the model for Western Europe until the seventeenth century."
 western_caracole_cavalry:1 "Caracollakavallerie"
 western_caracole_cavalryDESCR:1 "In the late sixteenth and early seventeenth century the most common combat formation for western European cavalry was the Caracole, which could be employed in two ways. With the first method, the first rank of the cavalry formation charged directly at the enemy, the cavalrymen firing their weapons at a range of 30 to 50 paces. Then they turned round again and returned to the rear of the formation and became the last rank. The following rank would charge in the same way, fire at the enemy and return to the rear. With this formation the first rank was always charging while the other ranks were loading and waiting their turn to charge. Another method was to charge in a single file, firing when the enemies were on their right and then continuing round in a circular motion, all the while reloading and returning to reform the lines in a continuous attack."
 western_cuirassier_cavalry:1 "Kürassiere"
 western_cuirassier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Cuirassiers was a type of heavy cavalry that evolved from the armored knight. This type of cavalry was armoured from his head down to knee-level. His body was protected with a breastplate, or 'Cuirass', from which they took their name. The breastplate was designed to withstand not only the shot from a pistol but also that of ball fired from a musket. They were armed with wheellock pistols, lances and swords. Cuirassiers were mostly used as shock troops and were in use for centuries."
 western_tercio_infantry:1 "Tercioinfanterie"
 western_tercio_infantryDESCR:1 "Early Square formations relied on pikemen to support a small number of arquebusiers, but as guns became deadlier and more reliable the number of arquebusiers in the square grew and the number of pikemen shrank from 2:1 to 1:2. By the end of the century most squares were dominated by arquebusiers, gaining increased firepower without sacrificing defense. This helped to keep the Tercio the predominant tactic used on the battlefield in Western Europe."
 western_soldaty_infantry:1 "Soldaty-Sturminfanterie"
 western_soldaty_infantryDESCR:1 "The Square formation was popular but had its limitations. It resulted in slow-moving, dense formations of arquebusiers that abandoned control of the battlefield to more manueverable opponents. Countries that relied on infantry to take the offensive abandoned the Square and adopted Soldaty tactics for their musketeers, combining muskets and halberds to take the battle to their enemy."
 western_gallop_cavalry:1 "Galoppkavallerie"
 western_gallop_cavalryDESCR:1 "Armies trained in Western European warfare quite often came out second best in combat against pistol armed cavalry in Eastern Europe. Faced with superior cavalry in the Polish Wars, the Swedish army developed Gallop Cavalry to compensate.  Although still armed with pistols like the Caracole, Gallop cavalry did not discharge the pistols as preliminary to shock action but as part of the charge itself. The results were devastating during the 30 years war."
 western_irregular_infantry:1 "Musketier-Irreguläre"
 western_irregular_infantryDESCR:1 "Lighter and handier matchlock muskets replaced the older arquebus. Muskets could fire a two-ounce ball nearly two hundred yards, making them much deadlier on the battlefield. However, the fifteen-pound guns were bulky and required a forked stick to rest the barrel on when firing, making loading complicated and lengthly.  Acting as irregulars, musketeers could take the initiative on the battlefield with their increased firepower and range.  It was this tactic which enabled the French Bluecoats to take the initiative on the battlefield and win countless battles."
 western_dragoon_cavalry:1 "Dragoner"
 western_dragoon_cavalryDESCR:1 "In the seventeenth century, a new type of cavalry called Dragoons was created. Dragoons were basically infantry who transported themselves by horse. The name Dragoon comes from the weapon they carried a short type of musket or carabine, called dragon. Dragoons were widely used by all European nations mostly because they were cheaper then normal cavalry."
 western_musketeersquare_infantry:1 "Musketierkarree"
 western_musketeersquare_infantryDESCR:1 "Lighter and handier matchlock muskets replaced the older arquebus. Muskets could fire a two-ounce ball nearly two hundred yards, making them much deadlier on the battlefield. However, the fifteen-pound guns were bulky and required a forked stick to rest the barrel on when firing, making loading complicated and lengthly.  The increased firepower and range made it a worthwhile investment, but the slow-moving musketeers were still used to support cavalry by many countries.  In particular, the Austrian Whitecoats and Spanish Tercios both made use of the musket to breathe new life into old tactics."
 western_countermarch_infantry:1 "Rüchmarschmusketiere"
 western_countermarch_infantryDESCR:1 "Although they were reaching parity with bows, muskets were still a risky weapon to rely on because once fired it took a long time to reload. Pikemen were required to protect the musketeers during reloading, limiting their offensive power. This changed in the early seventeenth century when Maurice of Nassau divided his musketeers into six ranks. The front rank fired, then moved to the back to reload while the next rank took their turn, and in so doing allowed the regiment to be firing at the enemy constantly. This required a great deal of training to be able to work together and a familiarity with their weapons, and to accomplish this, standard terms of command were introduced to guarantee uniformity."
 western_volley_infantry:1 "Salvenfeuermusketiere"
 western_volley_infantryDESCR:1 "During the thirty years war, Sweden's king Gustavus Adolphus revolutionized warfare by training his musketeers vigorously in a new tactic. Instead of using countermarch tactics, the troops were trained to stand in three lines so that at any time one line was kneeling, one line was crouching, and one line was firing at the enemy. This demanded an incredible level of discipline and training to accomplish, making Swedish troops some of the most professional in the world. In addition, regiments were reduced from 3,000 men to a mere 500, making them more manueverable on the battlefield."
 western_platoon_infantry:1 "Zugfeuermusketiere"
 western_platoon_infantryDESCR:1 "Bayonets were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century and were gradually refined and made more reliable.  Throughout the seventeenth century tactics remained the same: musketeers advanced slowly on the enemy, pausing to fire volleys at them in an attempt to break the enemy line, allowing cavalry to pursue and mop up the scattered enemy.  When this failed, a bayonet charge and hand-to-hand combat was necessary.  This tactic gradually made pikemen superflous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  Scottish Highlanders were known for being willing to charge the enemy just as much as shoot at them."
 western_regular_infantry:1 "Musketierreguläre"
 western_regular_infantryDESCR:1 "Bayonets were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century and were gradually refined and made more reliable.  Throughout the seventeenth century tactics remained the same: musketeers advanced slowly on the enemy, pausing to fire volleys at them in an attempt to break the enemy line, allowing cavalry to pursue and mop up the scattered enemy.

This tactic gradually made pikemen superflous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  British Redcoats used their bayonets to keep the enemy at bay while picking them off with musket fire."
 western_carabinier_cavalry:1 "Karabiniere"
 western_carabinier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the late sixteenth century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armour, though slightly less then a Cuirassier. The main difference between the two cavalry forces was their armament. A Carabinier's main weapon was the carbine, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carbine, they were also armed with a sword."
 western_armeblanche_cavalry:1 "Arme Blanche-Kavallerie"
 western_armeblanche_cavalryDESCR:1 "While the hussar Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, Arme Blanche cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."
 western_mediumhussar_cavalry:1 "Mittlere Hussare"
 western_mediumhussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Armored Knights remained the predominant form of cavalry in Western Europe long after other parts of the world had moved towards more mobile light cavalry.  At the battle of Adrianople, the cream of Western European nobility met the Ottoman light cavalry and was soundly defeated by their superior mobility.  In comparison, the Hungarians and Poles used lighter cavalry called Hussars that had more success.  Forced to confront this new reality, Western European armies began to adopt Polish Winged Hussar cavalry in place of the aristocratic knights."
 western_bayonet_infantry:1 "Bayonettinfanterie"
 western_bayonet_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century, and soon new tactics were developed to suit.  Now that musketeers had reliable bayonets, infantry charges were once again a viable strategy in battle, allowing them to once again claim the initiative on the battlefield."
 western_line_infantry:1 "Linieninfanterie"
 western_line_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century.  Soon afterwards, new tactics were developed to suit this reality.  The most popular and arguably most effective tactic was to form a thin line facing the enemy so that musketeers could inflict maximum casualties on the enemy and react quickly to enemy movement. This also allowed for specialized soldiers to appear along the line such as the grenadier."
 western_skirmisher_infantry:1 "Irreguläre Plänkler"
 western_skirmisher_infantryDESCR:1 "Standing armies were small, and even in the seventeenth century levies were called upon during wartime to make up the bulk of the army. These conscript troops did not have the training or discipline of regulars and were often distrusted by their commanders. With more accurate and faster guns making pike screens unnecessary, some commanders began using these men as irregular infantry who operated as marksmen and skirmishers in small units around the main army. These irregular skirmishers could help scout unfamiliar terrain, pin down enemy units until the main force could arrive, and best of all, were expendible. Austria in particular made great use of their 'Grenzers', who made up over a quarter of the Austrian army."
 western_hunter_cavalry:1 "Jägerkavallerie"
 western_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armored units trained for rapid action.  They specialized in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur de Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 western_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Ulane"
 western_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century Century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armored cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armor, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 western_lighthussar_cavalry:1 "Leichte Hussare"
 western_lighthussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "As Cavalry became more specialised, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the heavy Polish Hussar and more like the light Hungarian original. The ability of these light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harrass them, and overrun their artillery more than made up for their lack of armor."
 western_drill_infantry:1 "Drillinfanterie"
 western_drill_infantryDESCR:1 "Able to fight at close range or from further away, musketeers were versatile indeed - but only if they could react quickly to the shifting battlefield. Frederick of Prussia trained his men rigorously to deal with any situation that could conceivably come up until they became an incredible fighting force that never broke ranks and could fire as much as one shot every fifteen seconds under combat conditions!  This Prussian Drill infantry became the model army for the rest of the world after its stunning successes in battle and was used by both sides in the American Revolution."
 western_mass_infantry:1 "Masseninfanterie"
 western_mass_infantryDESCR:1 "A favorite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualities for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 western_rifled_infantry:1 "Gewehrmusketiere"
 western_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 western_columnar_infantry:1 "Säuleninfanterie"
 western_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward towards the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig in to entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."
 western_impulse_infantry:1 "Impulsinfanterie"
 western_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 western_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lanzenreiter"
 western_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 western_breech_infantry:1 "Hinterladermusketiere"
 western_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breach-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breach-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
 eastern_akritoi_infantry:1 "Akritoi Grenzer"
 eastern_akritoi_infantryDESCR:1 "Akritoi were soldier-farmers who were granted fiefs of land to farm along the military borders of the empire.  This provided the army with a ready source of soldiers near the fighting during wars.  They were lightly equipped and relied on bows and javelins.  They could be effective in ambushes, but also served as skirmishers to provide cover for the main army during pitched battles."
 eastern_mourtatoi_infantry:1 "Mourtatoi Bogenschützen"
 eastern_mourtatoi_infantryDESCR:1 "Supposedly the offspring of mixed marriages, mourtatoi were Turkish Muslims who fought in the Greek style for Christian nations using bows and crossbows.  Influenced by nearby Italy and Germany, they wore heavy coats of armor.  This allowed them to launch volleys of missiles against enemies and while withstanding enemy attacks, although they were still used primarily in support roles for the cavalry."
 eastern_hospite_infantry:1 "Hospites"
 eastern_hospite_infantryDESCR:1 "Many Western Balkan states imported officers and equipment from Italy and Germany, creating units of heavily armored footsoldiers wearing hauberks, coifs, greaves and gauntlets who fought in the Western style."
 eastern_horse_archer_cavalry:1 "Berittene Bogenschützen"
 eastern_horse_archer_cavalryDESCR:1 "Horse archers armored in the Byzantine style, with bows, maces and horse armor.  These medium cavalry were designed to be versatile, but were not particularly strong in any area."
 eastern_mountain_nomad_cavalry:1 "Bergnomaden"
 eastern_mountain_nomad_cavalryDESCR:1 "Many Balkan mountain people and highlanders remained semi-nomadic, and when times were tough thousands offered their services as mercenary auxillaries.  They fought as light cavalry, riding ponies and carrying equipment aquired from any available source, although javelins were their favored weapon.  The Albanians and Vlachs were both instrumental in the armies of Stefan Dusan's Serbian empire, for example."
 eastern_cuman_cavalry:1 "Kumanische leichte Kavallerie"
 eastern_cuman_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Cumans who settled in Hungary served as loyal cavalrymen.  They wore mail and carried spears and bows, allowing them to be versatile in combat.  Unlike their feudal counterparts, the Cuman preferred to wear less armor, allowing them to travel faster and manuever better on the battlefield."
 eastern_druzhina_cavalry:1 "Druzhinakavallerie"
 eastern_druzhina_cavalryDESCR:1 "Cavalry units equipped with battle-axes that made up the core of many eastern European armies. In peacetime the Druzhinas would most often serve as bodyguards or handle extractions of tribute."
 eastern_stratioti_infantry:1 "Stratioti"
 eastern_stratioti_infantryDESCR:1 "Stratioti were originally prisoners and rebels who were forcibly resettled in faraway parts of the empire.  Given a pronoia fief to farm, they owed military service in return for the income they earned on it.  By the mid fourteenth century, they had become a means of reforming the military as the Byzantine emperor seized church land to turn it into pronoia fiefs, swelling the ranks of his army with feudal troops.  They fought with bows and crossbows and wore padded armor.  However, their role on the battlefield was still to support the cavalry."
 eastern_bandiera_infantry:1 "Flaggeninfanterie"
 eastern_bandiera_infantryDESCR:1 "In the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, royal power was expanded by placing peasant armies recruited by local barons under royal control.  These 'bandiera' or flag infantry were transformed into the core of professional armies, replacing levied bowmen with light infantry who carried crossbows and, occasionally, javelins.  There were special competitions and exercises for them in the Balkans, where these crossbowmen were the most important infantry troops of the fourteenth century.  However, they were still used primarily to attack and defend obstacles rather than fight pitched battles."
 eastern_pronoia_cavalry:1 "Pronoiakavallerie"
 eastern_pronoia_cavalryDESCR:1 "Pronoia were fiefs of land large enough to support a single cavalryman, who served in the army in return for the income from the land.  Inspired by Cossack steppe warriors who sought refuge in the Balkans, they wore light lamellar hauberks and carried spears and swords."
 eastern_balkan_feudal_cavalry:1 "Feudale schwere Kavallerie"
 eastern_balkan_feudal_cavalryDESCR:1 "Inspired by German and Italian knights, many Balkan states maintained feudal levies of knights who wore plate mail.  These heavy cavalry were too slow to catch raiders or light cavalry, but they were powerful in battle and effective against western armies."
 eastern_hand_gunner:1 "Handfeuermusketier"
 eastern_hand_gunnerDESCR:1 "With the growing importance of firearms, some states trained troops to use arquebuses and matchlock muskets in battle.  No state did so more successfully than Hungary, whose famous Black Legion was made up of conscripted mercenaries from Bohemia and Germany.  The Black Legion was made up of one hand gunner for every four troops, a ratio that was quite high for the time.  Lightly armored, their role was to launch surprise attacks on the enemy while the cavalry screened them from enemy charges.  Although highly effective, the cost of maintaining a permanent paid army was ruinous to the state."
 eastern_waggonberg_infantry:1 "Waggonberginfanterie"
 eastern_waggonberg_infantryDESCR:1 "As firearms became increasingly effective, novel new tactics were developed to make use of them.  Inspired by tactics used in the Hussite Wars and brought with refugees fleeing from them into the Balkans, Balkan nations developed Tabor armored wagon trains with mounted guns that served not only as weapons, but as portable cover for armies that could be chained together to turn any battlefield into a defensive position for the army.  Hunyadi Janos famously used them in battle against the Ottomans by using the wagons in narrow valleys to bottle up enemy cavalry before flanking them with his own cavalry.  However, the wagons were of little use on the offensive and relied on cavalry to win the day against similarly defensive opponents."
 eastern_palaiologan_infantry:1 "Palaiologische Infanterie"
 eastern_palaiologan_infantryDESCR:1 "As the Byzantine empire shrunk, its rulers became increasingly incapable of raising an army to match the size of their enemies.  Instead, they changed tactics, making the best use of their smaller numbers.  The army became specialized in fortifying towns and cities, repairing walls, sieging enemy castles, and launching surprise ambushes, sometimes backed up by naval transport.  Pitched battles on open terrain were avoided whenever possible.  The crossbow continued to be the primary weapon of war, since firearms were expensive and often unsuited for the crumbling fortifications of the empire."
 eastern_balkan_light_cavalry:1 "Mittlere Kavallerie"
 eastern_balkan_light_cavalryDESCR:1 "Although heavy cavalry was strong against western armies, it was ineffective against Muslim raiders who relied on manueverable light cavalry.  As nations began to realize the true threat lay to the east, they began to place more importance on light cavalry.  They continued to use imported western arms and armor, but in smaller quanitities to allow for more speed."
 eastern_hussar_horse_archer_cavalry:1 "Hussarbogenschützen"
 eastern_hussar_horse_archer_cavalryDESCR:1 "With the increasing dominance of light cavalry on the battlefields of Eastern Europe, the Hussar became a staple of the battlefield.  Dressed in extravagant costumes but little or no armor, they relied on bows to pick off the enemy, and their speed to avoid direct confrontation.  They began as foreign mercenaries, giving them their Polish name of Racowie, 'Serbians'.  Increasingly, however, they were named 'Hussars', after the Slavonic word for bandit."
 eastern_deli_cavalry:1 "Deli-Kundschafter"
 eastern_deli_cavalryDESCR:1 "Known as 'hotheads', Serbian cavalry were famous for their extravagant costumes and their high morale.  They fought as irregular cavalry, but preferred to act as scouts, seeking out the enemy and returning with positions and numbers to aid in combat.  After the fall of Serbia, Deli scouts served in the armies of both the Ottoman Empire and their enemy Poland."
 eastern_draby_infantry:1 "Draby-Infanterie"
 eastern_draby_infantryDESCR:1 "Central European nations did not place much value on infantry, preferring to import them from Germany.  However, they did maintain armies of Draby - small contingents of pikemen who stayed among a larger force of arquebusiers, protecting them from immediate attack."
 eastern_pischalniki_infantry:1 "Arkuebusenmilitionär"
 eastern_pischalniki_infantryDESCR:1 "Many Eastern European states were slow to adopt firearms, but others made good use of them.  The Russian Pischal'niki militia carried heavy harquebus hand-guns into battle.  However, they were poorly trained and lightly armored, and the harquebuses they used required them to be placed on firing stands, then removed in order to reload them.  They made use of Waggonberg mobile obstacles to protect them from enemy fire and relied on the cavalry to keep enemy forces at range."
 eastern_winged_hussar_cavalry:1 "Mittlere Hussaren"
 eastern_winged_hussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hussars were light cavalry who fought in the style of bandits.  At first they served in a support role, moving faster than a heavy armored knight could.  Later, they began replacing them.  These medium hussars wore mail armor and carried lances.  The horses had to be well bred and well trained, costing as much as ten years salary for their rider."
 eastern_cossack_cavalry:1 "Kosackenräuber"
 eastern_cossack_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Russians, Poles and Hungarians found themselves at a disadvantage against Mongol cavalry along the Steppe.  They were fast and manueverable enough to avoid Russian counterattacks.  Often, the best defence against them was to bribe or coerce Cossack nomads into fighting against their own kin.  Soon, Cossack raiders became in demand as hardy, if undisciplined, horsemen.  These light cavalry carried lances and bows and lived off the land."
 eastern_pomeste_cavalry:1 "Pomestekavallerie"
 eastern_pomeschiki_cavalryDESCR:1 "A pomestie was land held by the gentry in exchange for a lifetime of military service.  Each pomestie and its peasant families was expected to supply one cavalryman and two horses when demanded.  The Pomeste cavalry that was raised in this manner was dramatically expanded under Ivan IV to become the backbone of the Russian army.  Pomeste carried spears, sabers and pistols, but their chief weapon was the bow, which they used in hit and run strikes.  Although they wore chain mail, they served as light cavalry.  Having learned from previous attempts to employ a feudal cavalry, the Russians also demanded that the Pomeste muster once a year to compare them to tax records."
 eastern_streltsy_infantry:1 "Strel'tsy-Musketiere"
 eastern_streltsy_infantryDESCR:1 "Rather than rely on mercenaries, Ivan IV created a permanent professional army called Strel'tsy ('Shooters').  Unlike previous forces, the Strel'tsy were armed and dressed uniformly, well trained, and paid on a regular basis.  This made them loyal and effective troops.  They were armed with arquebuses, and later with muskets.  In battle, they were placed in the middle of the line and fired from a stationary position at the enemy, relying on the cavalry to protect them.  In close combat, they switched to the heavy, two-handed axes that gave them a fearsome reputation.  But what made them different than regular troops was not their armament or tactics, but the fact that military service in the Strel'tsy was lifelong and hereditary.  This created an elite class of professional solider, but also bred resentment in the rest of the army."
 eastern_marauder_infantry:1 "Marodeurinfanterie"
 eastern_marauder_infantryDESCR:1 "As firearms became more effective, draby infantry were replaced with haiduks (marauders).  They were reputed to be large, fierce men who lived life roughly, and they were armed almost entirely with arquebuses and axes, with only one in ten carrying a pike.  Their role in combat was to support the cavalry, or for defending or attacking obstacles.  Only rarely were they called upon to fight hand to hand, and they did poorly against cavalry.  Despite these flaws, they became the standard infantry of Hungary and Poland.  By the mid seventeenth century, it was clear they also did poorly against more balanced pike and shot formations, and they were phased out."
 eastern_drabant_infantry:1 "Drabantwachen"
 eastern_drabant_infantryDESCR:1 "Believing Western infantry to be superior, many Eastern European nations hired soldiers and mercenaries from the West to train their infantry, or even to make up entire regiments of men.  Drabant infantry were German and Czech soldiers originally hired as elite royal guards such as the Polish Footguards.  They fought in the western style, with halberds and matchlock muskets in equal numbers."
 eastern_light_cossack_cavalry:1 "Leichte Kosacken"
 eastern_light_cossack_cavalryDESCR:1 "Early Cossack cavalry were raised from Zaporozhian Cossacks and Tatar refugees, but as it showed its value on the battlefield, increasingly gentry cavalrymen took to the style regardless of their ethnicity.  By the end of the sixteenth century, they had replaced their bows with carbines, and like the French Caracole, they were adept at shooting their pistols.  Unlike the Caracole, however, they maintained their distance from the enemy, preferring to avoid charges and hand-to-hand combat in favor of ranged combat and skirmishing."
 eastern_light_hussar:1 "Leichte Hussaren"
 eastern_light_hussarDESCR:1 "In Hungary, hussar cavalry became increasingly light, giving up armor entirely in order to emphasize speed and manueverability on the battlefield.  At the same time, their costumes became increasingly extravagant, inspiring poets to claim they were the most beautiful horsemen in the world.  Military observers were much more interested in their effectiveness on the battlefield against the Ottomans, something that did not escape the attention of western Europe.  The light hussar soon spread to the West, where it influenced cavalry tactics for a century."
 eastern_slavic_western_infantry:1 "Slavische westliche Infanterie"
 eastern_slavic_western_infantryDESCR:1 "Despite the success of Western style infantry on the battlefield, Eastern European nations were slow to train their own subjects to fight in a similar manner, instead preferring to hire foreigners.  The heavy demand for such mercenaries during the Thirty Years War prompted some states to break with this tradition, raising armies of westernized Slavs who fought with matchlock muskets, much to the displeasure of nobles who worried this could lead to well-armed peasant revolts."
 eastern_grenadier_infantry:1 "Grenadiere"
 eastern_grenadier_infantryDESCR:1 "Although Eastern Europeans were slow to adopt firearms, specialized troops known as Grenadiers defied this trend.  Replacing the more common matchlock muskets with more modern flintlocks, they fought with shot, bayonet and grenade, capable of stopping a cavalry charge."
 eastern_soldaty_infantry:1 "Soldaty-Sturminfanterie"
 eastern_soldaty_infantryDESCR:1 "A shift in tactics occurred as firearms became deadlier.  Instead of supporting the cavalry, Russian soldaty infantry took the offensive by combining muskets and halberds to take the battle to the enemy."
 eastern_pancerni_cavalry:1 "Pancerni Mittlere Kavallerie"
 eastern_pancerni_cavalryDESCR:1 "After the rebellion of the Cossacks, Cossack cavalry no longer had any relationship to true Cossacks.  Instead, it was renamed Pancerni, or 'mail-coated' medium cavalry.  They were extremely mobile cavalry who could be elusive when outnumbered.  They preferred close combat weapons such as swords over the long lances used by hussars, but when confronted with pikemen they were capable of firing with carbine pistols or bows from range instead.  Most came from the gentry."
 eastern_heavy_hussar:1 "Schwere Hussaren"
 eastern_heavy_hussarDESCR:1 "Hussar cavalry proved to be very effective.  As time went on, Polish hussars increasingly served as heavy cavalry, wearing plate cuirasses in order to protect them in hand to hand combat and against missiles.  They carried lances, sabres and long swords, and could launch a devastating charge against enemy lines."
 eastern_reiter_cavalry:1 "Reiter Schwere Kavallerie"
 eastern_reiter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Known as Reiters in Germany and Ratjars in Poland, these cavalrymen fought in Western fashion as cuirassieurs, lancers and arquebusiers.  They rode heavy warhorses and wore three-quarter armor.  Although not as famous as Eastern hussars and cossack cavalry, after the Polish disaster at Batoh, they supplanted hussars for over a decade."
 eastern_platoon_infantry:1 "Zugfeuermusketiere"
 eastern_platoon_infantryDESCR:1 "Bayonets were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century and were gradually refined and made more reliable.  Throughout the seventeenth century tactics remained the same: musketeers advanced slowly on the enemy, pausing to fire volleys at them in an attempt to break the enemy line, allowing cavalry to pursue and mop up the scattered enemy.  When this failed, a bayonet charge and hand-to-hand combat was necessary.  This tactic gradually made pikemen superflous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  Scottish Highlanders were known for being willing to charge the enemy just as much as to shoot at them."

This tactic gradually made pikemen superflous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  British Redcoats used their bayonets to keep the enemy at bay while picking them off with musket fire."
 eastern_carabinier_cavalry:1 "Karabiniere"
 eastern_carabinier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the late sixteenth century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armour, though slightly less then a Cuirassier. The main difference between the two cavalry forces was their armament. A Carabinier's main weapon was the carbine, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carbine, they were also armed with a sword."
 eastern_armeblanche_cavalry:1 "Arme Blanche-Kavallerie"
 eastern_armeblanche_cavalryDESCR:1 "While the hussar Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, Arme Blanche cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."
 eastern_bayonet_infantry:1 "Bajonettinfanterie"
 eastern_bayonet_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century, and soon new tactics were developed to suit.  Now that musketeers had reliable bayonets, infantry charges were once again a viable strategy in battle, allowing them to once again claim the initiative on the battlefield."
 eastern_line_infantry:1 "Linieninfanterie"
 eastern_line_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century.  Soon afterwards, new tactics were developed to suit this reality.  The most popular and arguably most effective tactic was to form a thin line facing the enemy so that musketeers could inflict maximum casualties on the enemy and react quickly to enemy movement. This also allowed for specialized soldiers to appear along the line such as the grenadier."
 eastern_skirmisher_infantry:1 "Irreguläre Plänkler"
 eastern_skirmisher_infantryDESCR:1 "Standing armies were small, and even in the seventeenth century levies were called upon during wartime to make up the bulk of the army. These conscript troops did not have the training or discipline of regulars and were often distrusted by their commanders. With more accurate and faster guns making pike screens unnecessary, some commanders began using these men as irregular infantry who operated as marksmen and skirmishers in small units around the main army. These irregular skirmishers could help scout unfamiliar terrain, pin down enemy units until the main force could arrive, and best of all, were expendible. Austria in particular made great use of their 'Grenzers', who made up over a quarter of the Austrian army."
 eastern_hunter_cavalry:1 "Jägerkavallerie"
 eastern_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armored units trained for rapid action.  They specialized in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur de Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 eastern_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Ulane"
 eastern_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century Century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armored cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armor, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 eastern_drill_infantry:1 "Drillinfanterie"
 eastern_drill_infantryDESCR:1 "Able to fight at close range or from further away, musketeers were versatile indeed - but only if they could react quickly to the shifting battlefield. Frederick of Prussia trained his men rigorously to deal with any situation that could conceivably come up until they became an incredible fighting force that never broke ranks and could fire as much as one shot every fifteen seconds under combat conditions!  This Prussian Drill infantry became the model army for the rest of the world after its stunning successes in battle and was used by both sides in the American Revolution."
 eastern_mass_infantry:1 "Masseninfanterie"
 eastern_mass_infantryDESCR:1 "A favorite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualities for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 eastern_rifled_infantry:1 "Gewehrmusketiere"
 eastern_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 eastern_columnar_infantry:1 "Säuleninfanterie"
 eastern_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward towards the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig in to entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."
 eastern_impulse_infantry:1 "Impulsinfanterie"
 eastern_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 eastern_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lanzenreiter"
 eastern_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 eastern_breech_infantry:1 "Hinterladerinfanterie"
 eastern_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breach-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breach-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
 muslim_mashain_walker_infantry:1 "Mashainläufer"
 muslim_mashain_walker_infantryDESCR:1 "Infantry troops who trained to fight defensively, Mashain walkers fought in formation, with the outer ranks carrying spears and pikes, the middle ranks holding shields and javelins, and the inner ranks made up of slingers and archers.  With Mashain tactics, the cavalry's role was to support the infantry, remaining in the center of the formation ready to charge through any holes exposed by the enemy.  Although Mashain tactics were the hallmark of earlier North African empires, they continued to be used by their successor states for some time."
 muslim_arab_horseman:1 "Arabische Reiter"
 muslim_arab_horsemanDESCR:1 "In the Arab tradition, horsemen fought wearing mail hauberks and leather shields and fighting from horseback with spears.  This style of fighting was popular across North Africa as well as Arabia.  They often served for pay during campaigns, then returned to the deserts when unneeded.  They could also guard roads, transport provisions and act as messengers for the army."
 muslim_armored_infantry:1 "Schwere Infanterie"
 muslim_armored_infantryDESCR:1 "Slow-moving infantry wearing mail hauberks and carrying axes.  These troops were found in areas that faced similar heavy infantry, such as the Nasrid Emirate of Granada."
 muslim_faris_cavalry:1 "Faris Schwere Kavallerie"
 muslim_faris_cavalryDESCR:1 "Like the Crusaders they fought against, Muslim cavalrymen often wore heavy armor including a full mail hauberk and shield.  They carried lances, but unlike their Christian counterparts, preferred fighting with composite bows and curved swords.  Since their swords were unable to cut through enemy armor, they targeted enemy horses instead."
 muslim_rajjala_infantry:1 "Rajjala Leichte Kavallerie"
 muslim_rajjala_infantryDESCR:1 "Professional footsoldiers who first saw combat in 1275 against the Crusaders, Rajjala were mostly used for sieges and town defence, but also slew friendly cavalry who tried to flee the battle in order to encourage the cavalry to stand and fight.  They were mostly archers and arbalesters, lightly armored and not much use in hand to hand combat."
 muslim_halqa_irregular_infantry:1 "Harfush Irreguläre"
 muslim_halqa_irregular_infantryDESCR:1 "Harfush, or 'rabble', were auxillary infantry that were used in siege and mountain warfare.  They were often taken from the ranks of defeated enemies or unemployed soldiers who accepted an offer to join the military.  They had to provide their own arms and living quarters, and maintained their original command structure.  Both of these traits resulted in incredible variation in quality.  However, their ranks swelled the army, and by institutionalizing them, it prevented them from becoming the focal point of rebellions and gave peasants something to aspire to."
 muslim_amir_mamluk_cavalry:1 "Amirische Mamlukenkavallerie"
 muslim_amir_mamluk_cavalryDESCR:1 "Mamluks were slave soldiers, captured as children from Turkish lands to serve as soldiers.  The Amir's Mamluks made up the majority of their ranks, belonging to units that were out of favor, raised by provincial Amirs, or having been recruited by past Sultans.  These Amir Mamluks recieved lower pay and worse equipment and training than the elite Royal Mamluks, but were still a formidable force.  They wore mail armor and carried spears, maces and daggers.  They were trained to make feigned retreats, flank the enemy, and loose arrows at him."
 ottoman_akinci_light_cavalry:1 "Akinci Leichte Kavallerie"
 ottoman_akinci_light_cavalryDESCR:1 "With the Mongol success in Asia, Turcoman nomads were forced out of their traditional lands and sought refuge among their Turkish cousins.  They often served in Turkish armies as horse-archers, fighting in the Mongol style with swords, lassos and bows.  Some wore lamellar cuirasses.  Although fierce, they were not able to capture towns or enemy fortifications, so they were used primarily as raiders and scouts.  When an entire tribe served in this manner, they were called Yorouks."
 ottoman_ghazi_infantry:1 "Ghazikrieger"
 ottoman_ghazi_infantryDESCR:1 "Inspired by their faith to fight a holy war against the infidel, thousands of volunteers came from across Islam to the frontiers with heathens.  The Turks were able to take advantage of this to recruit them into their army, where they served as mixed forces.  They followed a personal code of honor and wore distinctive white felt caps."
 ottoman_azap_infantry:1 "Azapbogenschützen"
 ottoman_azap_infantryDESCR:1 "Azaps were light infantry whose task was to keep enemy forces at bay with their bows until regular troops had gotten into formation.  They were conscript troops called up during a campaign, then returned to their homes.  The Azaps were divided into Deniz Azaps (Marines) and Kale Azaps (Garrison troops)."
 ottoman_musellem_cavalry:1 "Musellemkavallerie"
 ottoman_musellem_cavalryDESCR:1 "Musellem, or 'tax-free' cavalry, was developed as a way to provide the Turks with their own cavalry army.  In return for military service, Musellem received small fiefs from their loyal bey, who in turn was responsible for leading a hundred or thousand horsemen in battle.  While the system was successful in creating a permanent army, it led to regional governors having command of armies and the musellems were gradually relegated to second-line duties."
 ottoman_yaya_infantry:1 "Yayainfanterie"
 ottoman_yaya_infantryDESCR:1 "Mercenary footsoldier archers who carried bows and crossbows and wore heavy coats of armor.  This allowed them to launch volleys of missiles against enemies and while withstanding enemy attacks, although they were used primarily in support roles for the cavalry."
 muslim_halqa_regular_infantry:1 "Halqareguläre"
 muslim_halqa_regular_infantryDESCR:1 "Halqa were freeborn soldiers who fought as infantry.  When they were used as the primary soldiers of a nation, Halqa were rewarded with large fiefs (iqta) which were passed down through military families, maintaining unit cohesion and training.  They wore mail or lamellar armor and carried axes and maces.  These Halqa were effective troops who fought for pay and to defend their families."
 muslim_incendiary_infantry:1 "Jandarinfanterie"
 muslim_incendiary_infantryDESCR:1 "First used against Iberian Christians, then later against the Mongols, incendiary infantry used flaming arrows, firecrackers (sawarikh), Greek fire (naft), grenades and hand-held cannons (midfa) to frighten enemy horses, which were often the main enemy force.  They wore thick black woolen cloth coated with fire-proof talc to protect themselves from burns and carried swords in order to fight at close quarters.  However, they suffered from a limited range and duration of their weapons, and saw only limited use in combat."
 muslim_crossbow_infantry:1 "Armbrustschützen"
 muslim_crossbow_infantryDESCR:1 "Needing to fight at sea as well as on land, the Muslims of North Africa developed marine crossbowmen who could use their weapons well in both theatres.  They carried crossbows, swords and daggers, and wore light armor with weatherproof cloaks."
 muslim_ghuzat_infantry:1 "Ghuzatinfanterie"
 muslim_ghuzat_infantryDESCR:1 "Ghazi or Ghuzat, as they were known in North Africa, were volunteers who saw jihad as a religious obligation.  They often travelled great distances to join the armies of nations along the frontiers of Islam, such as Nasrid Granada.  They were mostly crossbowmen who wore mail hauberks, and despite their high morale, were not always disciplined troops."
 muslim_jinete_cavalry:1 "Jinete Leichte Kavallerie"
 muslim_jinete_cavalryDESCR:1 "The famous Almogavers of Granada were light cavalry who wore only cuirasses and helmets, fighting with broad bladed swords and javelins.  They were fast and manueverable cavalry who were adept at hunting down and destroying raiding parties."
 muslim_royal_mamluk_cavalry:1 "Königliche Mamlukenkavallerie"
 muslim_royal_mamluk_cavalryDESCR:1 "Mamluks were slave soldiers, captured as children from Turkish lands and trained in military schools to become elite soldiers before being freed by the Sultan, whose personal army was called the Royal Mamluks.  They wore lamellar or mail armor and carried heavy lances, swords, maces, composite bows and crossbows.  They relied on mobility, discipline, and the ability to fight both at range and at close quarters.  If the enemy charged, they would loose arrows while at rest, then scatter.  A trained Mamluk was said to be able to loose three arrows in one and a half seconds!  Once the enemy was slowed down from its wounds, they would attack, aiming at standard bearers and drummers especially to disrupt enemy communications.  A favorite tactic was to feign retreat and then flank the enemy.  Royal Mamluks participated in an intense daily regimen of polo, archery, fencing and wrestling in order to stay in shape."
 muslim_mongol_cavalry:1 "Mongolenkavallerie"
 muslim_mongol_cavalryDESCR:1 "The success of the Mongols in Asia sent thousands of Turks and Turkoman Muslims fleeing into Muslim lands.  These freeborn soldiers were welcomed into the armies of nations such as Egypt, Persia and Arabia, where they fought in their traditional style of horse archers."
 ottoman_voyniq_heavy_infantry:1 "Voyniq Schwere Kavallerie"
 ottoman_voyniq_heavy_infantryDESCR:1 "When a heathen country was conquered by Muslims, their existing military elites were often incorporated into the conquering army, allowing them to keep fiefs they owned in exchange for serving their new masters in the same way.  Christian knights in the Balkans and former Byzantine empire often accepted Islam in order to maintain their former positions in society, willingly serving as shock troops for their new overlords.  This not only created a military fighting force, it also helped to encourage the locals to accept the new religion."
 ottoman_bashi_bazouk_infantry:1 "Bashi Bazouk"
 ottoman_bashi_bazouk_infantryDESCR:1 "Unpaid infantry who fought alongside the army in hopes of gaining a share of the loot.  Becuase of their lack of discipline, they were not used in major military operations, instead performing the roles of reconnaisance, outpost duty, and skirmishing."
 ottoman_janissary_infantry:1 "Janitschareninfanterie"
 ottoman_janissary_infantryDESCR:1 "Upon capturing a major heathen city, the Turks would enslave its inhabitants.  They would serve on farms, learning Turkish and the Muslim faith, then would be conscripted into the army.  After the capture of Edirne swelled their ranks to unheard of levels, the Sultan formally created the Janissary slave corps.  At first, their organization was inspired by the Ghazi warriors who made up early Turkish armies, but over time, they began to develop their own military organization and culture.  They were paid a monthly salary and lived in barracks, promoted by seniority and retired with pensions.  They fought with bows, slings, crossbows and javelins, and were famous for their discipline and morale.  They wore distinctive white felt caps which showed their origins as holy warriors."
 ottoman_derbent_cavalry:1 "Derbent Leichte Kavallerie"
 ottoman_derbent_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Akinci were useful cavalry, but their limited numbers were a liability that would eventually be their undoing.  As the Turks expanded, they began to include other tribes and conquered heathens as auxillary cavalry to expand their army, including Anatolian and Yorouk tribesmen and eventually Crimean Tatars.  These tribesmen fought from horseback with lances and bows, but were not a disciplined fighting force and were not always completely loyal.  Despite these flaws, they made up a significant part of the Turkish army."
 muslim_rammaha_lancer_cavalry:1 "Rammahalanzenreiter"
 muslim_rammaha_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "By the fifteenth century, slave cavalry had adopted heavy lances and horse armor like their European counterparts, allowing them to make devastating charges and fight in close quarters with their heavy sabres and maces."
 muslim_qizilbash_cavalry:1 "Qizilbashkavallerie"
 muslim_qizilbash_cavalryDESCR:1 "Tribal nomads, the Qizilbash were lifelong warriors who trained in the sword, lance, mace and bow.  This made them fearsome foes who were also familiar with the landscape.  They wore distinctive red and gold striped headgear, giving them their name of 'red heads' (Qizilbash)."
 ottoman_sipahi_cavalry:1 "Sipahi"
 ottoman_sipahi_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Musellem system was expanded in the early fifteenth century, becoming the majority of most Ottoman armies.  An ordinary fief (timar) supported a single horseman (timariot), while larger fiefs were expected to bring light cavalry retainers (jebels) with them to war.  The key part of this system was that the timars were held in trust by their holders, who could not pass them down to their children.  Most Sipahi timariots wore no armor and carried light weaponry, but their morale and horsemanship was said to be among the highest."
 ottoman_janissary_arquebusier_infantry:1 "Janitscharenarkebusiere"
 ottoman_janissary_arquebusier_infantryDESCR:1 "Having faced defeats at the hand of Christian arquebusiers and Mamluk cavalry, Janissaries began to adopt firearms of their own throughout the fifteenth century.  However, unlike their European counterparts, Turkish arquebusiers tended to fire at the enemy, then charge straight at them."
 ottoman_topchis_infantry:1 "Topchisinfanterie"
 ottoman_topchis_infantryDESCR:1 "The Janissaries were slow to adopt new weapons or tactics, so the Sultan created an entirely new corps called the Topchis.  These were peasants, recruited into the army and trained to become musketeers.  Unlike the Janissaries and Sipahis, they were paid troops rather than feudal ones - but because of this, were only called upon during wartime.  As a result, they were scattered across the empire and needed to be reassembled and retrained whenever a campaign was launched."
 muslim_elchee_infantry:1 "Elcheeinfanterie"
 muslim_elchee_infantryDESCR:1 "Although they could be resolute foes, many Christians had no problem accepting Muslim coin.  European mercenaries, prisoners and converts to Islam brought their expertise with guns and cannons with them, fighting alongside Muslim armies, training their troops, and even founding Christian towns in Muslim territory.  They fought just as hard as their Muslim counterparts, knowing they would receive no mercy from Christian soldiers."
 muslim_ghulam_infantry:1 "Ghulambogenschützen"
 muslim_ghulam_infantryDESCR:1 "Slave archers who used two-foot bows and wore light armor, they were often displaced slaves who were extremely loyal to the state for providing their livelihood.  This made them an excellent counterbalance to cavalry, who were often tribes who brought their politics alongside their warriors.  In Persia, the Safavid Shahs attempted to displace the Qizilbash with Ghulams.  In Egypt, they were a cheaper variety of Mamluk."
 ottoman_kapikulu_cavalry:1 "Kapikulukavallerie"
 ottoman_kapikulu_cavalryDESCR:1 "In an attempt to limit the power of the provinces, a national army called the Kapikulu was founded that was paid directly by the Sultan.  Promising young slaves taken as tribute would be sent to learn language, religion, science, athletics, leadership and combat training, then would be rewarded with service in the Kapikulu.  Under later Sultans, this program was expanded dramatically by taking fiefs (timars) away from the provincial armies and giving them to the Kapikulu instead.  As the cavalry arm of the Janissary corps, the Kapikulu held a high status in the army."
 ottoman_tabur_infantry:1 "Taburinfanterie"
 ottoman_tabur_infantryDESCR:1 "Campaigns in Hungary and the Balkans brought the Ottomans into contact with Tabur (Tabor, or Hussite) infantry tactics.  Pioneered in the Hussite Wars of Central Europe, this involved the use of top-arabalari armored gun wagons which could be chained together to form mobile barricades.  This provided cover for arquebusiers in order to hold their own against cavalry.  The drawback of Tabur armies was their focus on defensiveness - wagons were not much use on the offensive, and needed cavalry to take the battle to the enemy."
 muslim_arquebusier:1 "Arkebusiere"
 muslim_arquebusierDESCR:1 "As they faced gunpowder weapons in their enemies, Muslim nations began to adopt the weapons themselves, sometimes brought by Europeans hoping to divide Muslims against each other.  These early arquebuesiers were found from Morocco to Persia."
 muslim_qoorchilar_cavalry:1 "Qoorchilarwachen"
 muslim_qoorchilar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Qoorchilar were the royal guard, an elite drawn from the ranks of tribal Qizilbash cavalry.  They were known to be resolute, brave and highly disciplined horsemen who fought with the curved shamshir sword.  They also carried spears and muskets, allowing them to be versatile on the battlefield."
 muslim_reformed_qizilbash_cavalry:1 "Qizilbash Schwere Kavallerie"
 muslim_reformed_qizilbash_cavalryDESCR:1 "As the Qizilbash became more of a standard army rather than tribal units, they began to wear helmets and armor, helping to make them stronger in hand to hand combat.  They continued to fight with their traditional swords, lances, maces and bows."
 muslim_tofangchi_musketeer_infantry:1 "Tofangchimusketiere"
 muslim_tofangchi_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Attempting to break the power of tribal cavalry, some Muslim rulers began recruiting local peasants, arming them with muskets and giving them horses so that they could travel long distances quickly in order to reach the enemy or leave camp quietly.  However, Tofangchi soldiers fought as infantry, massing their fire against enemy lines.  They came from hardy peasant stock, making them tough soldiers but also making them low status troops, the last refuge of the professional soldier."
 ottoman_suvareleri_cavalry:1 "Suvarelerikavallerie"
 ottoman_suvareleri_cavalryDESCR:1 "As part of the Devirshirme system, a tax on heathens provided a supply of young slaves for the army and bureaucracy (Janissaries).  Mounted slave soldiers who went through the Devirshime system of training were called Suvarileri, and were considered an elite force answerable only to the Sultan.  They were loyal, professional soldiers who fought from horseback with muskets and lances and made up the backbone of Ottoman cavalry for some time."
 ottoman_sekban_infantry:1 "Sekbaninfanterie"
 ottoman_sekban_infantryDESCR:1 "Sekbans were irregular troops raised with a special tax to supplement the regular army during times of war.  Originally these troops were little more than rabble, but as time went on, they began to use muskets to fight, and by the end of the sixteenth century were a match for the Janissaries in battle.  The Sultans began to rely on them to counter the influence of the Janissaries at court.  However, the weakness of the Sekban was that they were paid by a special levy only during campaigns.  During peacetime, some turned to banditry."
 ottoman_janissary_musketeer_infantry:1 "Janitscharenmusketiere"
 ottoman_janissary_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "By the end of the sixteenth century, the Sultan had implemented major reforms of the army in an attempt to modernize it.  One of his initiatives was to introduce matchlock muskets as the primary weapon of the Janissaries.  The Tufenk matchlock muskets used by the Turks were longer and fired heavier bullets than their European equivalents."
 ottoman_reformed_sipahi_cavalry:1 "Reformierte Sipahis"
 ottoman_reformed_sipahi_cavalryDESCR:1 "Despite losses on the battlefield, it was only around the seventeenth century that the Sipahi finally adopted firearms, carrying pistols with them onto the battlefield.  The weapons were seen as unchivalrous by the Sipahi, who valued their long traditions.  However, the addition of firearms was undeniably effective.  They wore mail and plate armor and carried two swords in addition to a pair of pistols."
 muslim_jazayerchi_musketeer_infantry:1 "Jazayerchi Musketeers"
 muslim_jazayerchi_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "These elite troops carried a heavy musket that required a tripod to fire, making them slow but powerful weapons.  They were also armed with curved shamshir swords for close combat, but preferred to fight at range.  They trained for three hours a day to become excellent sharpshooters."
 ottoman_deli_light_cavalry:1 "Deli leichte Kavallerie"
 ottoman_deli_light_cavalryDESCR:1 "A series of defeats led to the disbandment of the Akincis.  Their role as scouts and messengers was taken over by the Deli light cavalry.  At first, Delis were predominantly made up of converts to Islam from conquered peoples.  With their knowledge of local terrain they proved invaluable to occupation forces, but they were seen as traitors to their own people and faced a painful death if caught by their countrymen.  In return, they could be brutal against their former comrades.  Their name probably comes from the Turkish word Delil, or guide, but they were commonly called Deli, or mad, because of their fearsome appearance."
 ottoman_tufek_musketeer_infantry:1 "Tufekcimusketiere"
 ottoman_tufek_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "During the seventeenth century it became apparent that attempts to reform the Janissaries and Timariots were doomed.  The Sultan made the decision to copy the success of Christian armies and their heavy emphasis on firepower.  Bringing in European experts, he trained a new army of Musketeers to rival the Janissaries, fighting along European lines.  Their Tufenk matchlock muskets were larger, more accurate, and slower to fire than their European equivalents."
 muslim_zanbourak_camel_cavalry:1 "Zanbourakkavallerie"
 muslim_zanbourak_camel_cavalryDESCR:1 "Inspired by the Arab tradition of mounting heavy crossbows on camels, later armies began mounting gunpowder weapons on them instead.  These camel-mounted guns were inaccurate and had short ranges, but were highly manueverable on the battlefield.  They could be deployed far forward on the battlefield and famously caused panic and disorder in enemy forces who were not expecting this kind of attack."
 muslim_piyadegan_infantry:1 "Piyadegan schwere Kavallerie"
 muslim_piyadegan_infantryDESCR:1 "The Piyadegan were developed in tandem with heavy artillery.  Armed with spears, swords, daggers, maces and axes, they would charge into enemy lines after the artillery had made a hole for them.  While waiting for this kind of opening, they would use composite bows against enemy troops."
 muslim_gharachoorlooha_musketeer_infantry:1 "Gharachoorloohamusketiere"
 muslim_gharachoorlooha_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Light musketeers who loaded their gunpowder with a horn, allowing them to vary how much powder to use.  This gave them more control over the range of their shots, but also slowed down their rate of fire.  To compensate for this weakness, they were drilled in line firing.  They were very effective against cavalry.  At close range, they would switch to shamshir swords instead."
 muslim_savaran_saltani_cavalry:1 "Savaran schwere Kavallerie"
 muslim_savaran_saltani_cavalryDESCR:1 "Savaran e Saltani cavalry was a heavy cavalry who specialized in close-quarter combat.  Paid for directly by the ruler, they were willing to risk their mounts in combat.  They wore mail and plate armor and spiked helmets to stop enemy swords.  They fought with swords and spears, but also carried muskets.  The most famous Savaran were the Qizilbash e Naderi of Persia, introduced as a result of Nader Shah's reforms of the Qizilbash."
 ottoman_panduk_sharpshooter_infantry:1 "Pandukscharfschützen"
 ottoman_panduk_sharpshooter_infantryDESCR:1 "To avoid rebellions, the Turks banned villagers (Reaya) from possessing weapons.  However, as firearms became deadlier, they began to see the need for peasants to be allowed to fight.  They began by hiring Christian huntsmen, then later formed sharpshooter companies out of peasant hunters.  They acted as mounted infantry who could travel quickly and fire at range.  They were among the most effective infantry the Turks had.  These frontiersmen fiercely resisted foreign incursion into their lands with ambushes and joined the main army as skirmishers to repel invaders."
 muslim_two_horned_tofangchi_infantry:1 "Zweigehörnte Tofangchis"
 muslim_two_horned_tofangchi_infantryDESCR:1 "Unlike their European counterparts, Persian musketeers developed heavier guns that had longer ranges.  Weighing about forty pounds each, they needed to rest on two tripods or 'horns' in order to be fired, causing them to be slow but powerful weapons."
 muslim_taifat_al_rusa_infantry:1 "Ta'ifat al Ru'sa Piraten"
 muslim_taifat_al_rusa_infantryDESCR:1 "Berber pirates were a constant source of friction, but they also provided a steady source of corsairs who could easily be conscripted and used as marines.  These Ta'ifat al Ru'sa, or Ship Captain Militias, were invaluable in naval warfare and amphibious attacks, replacing regular soldiers such as the Deniz Azaps and Levend of the sixteenth century."
 ottoman_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lanzenreiter"
 ottoman_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "Just as the infantry had undergone reforms, Turkish cavalry began to adopt European methods and formed lancer corps."
 ottoman_toprakli_dragoon_infantry:1 "Topraklidragoner"
 ottoman_toprakli_dragoon_infantryDESCR:1 "With the demise of the Janissaries, there was space to design a new, modern Turkish army.  The Sultan copied ideas from the west to develop a new model army called Nizam-I Cedid.  The prize of this new army were the dragoons, infantry soldiers armed with sabers and carbines who rode on horses to the battlefield, then dismounted in order to fight using western tactics.  This allowed the Turks to make use of their strong cavalry traditions to try and reform the infantry."
 muslim_hunter_cavalry:1 "Jägerkavallerie"
 muslim_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armored units trained for rapid action.  They specialized in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur de Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 muslim_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Ulane"
 muslim_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century Century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armored cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armor, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 muslim_lighthussar_cavalry:1 "Leichte Hussaren"
 muslim_lighthussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "As Cavalry became more specialised, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the heavy Polish Hussar and more like the light Hungarian original. The ability of these light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harrass them, and overrun their artillery more than made up for their lack of armor."
 muslim_drill_infantry:1 "Drillinfanterie"
 muslim_drill_infantryDESCR:1 "Able to fight at close range or from further away, musketeers were versatile indeed - but only if they could react quickly to the shifting battlefield. Frederick of Prussia trained his men rigorously to deal with any situation that could conceivably come up until they became an incredible fighting force that never broke ranks and could fire as much as one shot every fifteen seconds under combat conditions!  This Prussian Drill infantry became the model army for the rest of the world after its stunning successes in battle and was used by both sides in the American Revolution."
 muslim_mass_infantry_tactics:1 "Masseninfanterie"
 muslim_mass_infantry_tacticsDESCR:1 "A favorite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualities for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 muslim_rifled_infantry:1 "Gewehrmusketiere"
 muslim_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 muslim_columnar_infantry:1 "Säuleninfanterie"
 muslim_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward towards the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig in to entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."
 muslim_impulse_infantry:1 "Impulsinfanterie"
 muslim_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 muslim_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lanzenreiter"
 muslim_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 muslim_breech_infantry:1 "Hinterladerinfanterie"
 muslim_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breach-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breach-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."

 asian_mixed_crossbow_infantryDESCR:1 "Mixed infantry who fought in Song Chinese style: the front ranks carried spears and shields, protecting the back ranks of crossbowmen who fired at the enemy.  When available, they also used hand-held 'fire arrow' rockets against the enemy.   The Han Chun armies of Yuan China were a good example of this style of warfare."
 asian_warrior_monk_infantry:1 "Warrior Monks"
 asian_warrior_monk_infantryDESCR:1 "Known as Sohei in Japan and Taeguk or Hang-Ma-Gun in Korea, Buddhist monks were a common sight on the battlefield.  Although nominally pacifist, Buddhist monks were known to pursue the art of war, and some monasteries celebrated it by teaching martial arts and intervening in local conflicts.  Monasteries could amass large armies of monks supplemented by peasants who had earned a license as a Buddhist monk in order to avoid taxation.   They were lightly armored and armed, but many fought with high spirits.  They carried a mix of weaponry, often spears and pole arms."

 asian_light_foot_infantry:1 "Light Footsoldiers"
 asian_light_foot_infantryDESCR:1 "With the cavalry being the primary weapon of war, infantry were an afterthought for many armies.   Often, they consisted of peasants and criminals who joined feudal armies in return for a share of the loot of the battlefield.  They were undisciplined and ill equipped but also cheap, and were often used to support heavier troops.  They wore as much armor as they could afford and carried a variety of weapons including swords and spears, making them a mixed force without much cohesion."
 asian_crossbow_elephant_cavalry:1 "Crossbow Elephants"
 asian_crossbow_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "Khmer troops put Chinese double-row crossbows on elephants, using them as portable missile platforms.  Since enemies kept their distance from the beasts, it allowed the riders to harass the enemy as well as scout the battlefield and signal friendly troops."
 asian_heavy_elephant_cavalry:1 "Heavy Elephants"
 asian_heavy_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "Heavy war elephants carried one noble rider as well as a mahout (driver and attendant) in a howdah on the back of the elephant, protected by shields.  They were placed in the center of the line, able to launch unstoppable charges against enemy infantry, in which they would trample or gore enemy soldiers who did not flee, while their rider would use a trident or spear.  They were useful against cavalry as well, since horses would refuse to get close to the mammoths.  However, when an elephant was in pain or lost its mahout it could go into a frenzy and devastate friendly forces, making it a two-edged sword."
 asian_fire_lance_cavalry:1 "Fire Lancers"
 asian_fire_lance_cavalryDESCR:1 "Heavy cavalry who wore iron plates under fabric and carried a 'pear-flower spear', a type of fire lance that was tipped with a hollow tube filled with gunpowder that could be lit to act as a kind of primitive flamethrower."
 asian_horse_archer_cavalry:1 "Horse Archers"
 asian_horse_archer_cavalryDESCR:1 "With the success of the Mongols in Asia, many countries adopted their style of warfare out of self-defence, or simply hired Mongol mercenaries to act as their cavalry.  These troops acted as horse archers, training in marksmanship.  They used their bows to harass the enemy, staying well outside of their reach with their superior speed."
 asian_singi_cavalry:1 "Sing'i Cavalry"
 asian_singi_cavalryDESCR:1 "To provide defense against the Mongols, cavalry units known as Sin'gi were placed along the Frontier Districts.  Like the nomads they fought, they were skilled with the bow, but also fought with javelins.  They were heavily armored and trained by playing polo against each other."
 asian_war_elephant_cavalry:1 "War Elephants"
 asian_war_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "Originally the sign of nobility, increasingly war elephants were maintained by the army and ridden by professional soldiers and officers instead of aristocrats.  Their riders wielded javelins, the mahout passing him new ones so he could keep up a steady fire.  The elephants continued to fight as shock cavalry that could trample enemy infantry, and continued to have the same weaknesses as always.  Some limited attempts to armor the elephants failed miserably, and attention was turned to protecting the flanks with an infantry screen instead."
 asian_lancer_bow_cavalry:1 "Bow Lancers"
 asian_lancer_bow_cavalryDESCR:1 "Heavy cavalry who wore a helmet and brigandine armor and carried a sabre, round shield and lance.  They were unable to face spear-armed infantry directly, so waited until the enemy had been softened up before charging into battle."

 asian_elite_horse_cavalryDESCR:1 "Originally the armed retinue of an aristocratic family, after seizing power the Mabyeolcho'o (Elite Horse) was expanded into a regular cavalry corps collected from the best horsemen in the army.  Elite Horse Guards trained in horseback archery by hunting, and fought according to Mongol style but with more use of heavy armor."
 asian_bushi_cavalry:1 "Bushi"
 asian_bushi_cavalryDESCR:1 "A professional caste of soldier who received a fief of land in return for feudal service during war.  The samurai style of combat, called 'the way of horse and bow', was designed to combat the Mongol threat; they wore heavy lamellar o-yoroi armor and fought primarily with bows from horseback, although they could dismount to set up shield walls to launch arrows from.  They also carried a sword if they were forced into melee combat, but this was used as a last resort.  Samurai followed a code of honor known as Bushido similar to European knights."
 asian_phkap_infantry:1 "Phkap Infantry"
 asian_phkap_infantryDESCR:1 "The Phkap was a curved blade mounted on the end of a pole, giving the weapon a longer range than a sword.  It allowed lightly armored infantry to slash, but required troops to be spread out to have enough space to fight properly."
 asian_fire_lance_infantry:1 "Fire Lance Troops"
 asian_fire_lance_infantryDESCR:1 "Infantry soldiers carrying a variety of weapons, led by officers with fire lances.  Fire lances were tubes filled with black powder attached to the end of a spear, used as a kind of primitive flamethrower.  They were first used by the Chinese, but then used against them by their enemies."
 asian_halberdier_infantry:1 "Halberdiers"
 asian_halberdier_infantryDESCR:1 "Infantry soldiers were granted plots of land in return for both their military support and direct supply of their comrades, with 4 out of 5 men working the land while their fifth comrade served in the army.  Infantry soldiers continued to fight in two ranks: melee in front, ranged behind them.  The front ranks now carried halberd-like pole arms and spears with hooks to unhorse cavalry, while the rear guard held crossbows, fire arrows and, occasionally, large handheld metal tubes that could fire bolts or numbers of metal balls at the enemy using gunpowder.  These 'hand guns' were slow to reload and were not especially long ranged, making them not very effective against the Mongol threat, but they could be very effective against infantry in fixed fortifications.  Emperor Yongle was so taken with them that he ordered his troops to open fire with guns before following up with arrows."
 asian_shashu_no_ashigaru_infantry:1 "Mixed Archers"
 asian_shashu_no_ashigaru_infantryDESCR:1 "Inspired by the Mongol hordes who used bows so effectively, some generals began making use of infantry as bowmen, defending them with spearmen.  Although the badly-trained archers were no match for sharpshooter cavalry, they made up for it with sheer numbers.  They were made up of a small core of retainers loyal to their lord supported by casual volunteers enticed by loot during war.  As a result, they lacked discipline and weaponry and armor tended to differ wildly between soldiers."
 asian_fire_arrow_rocket_infantry:1 "Fire Arrow Rocketeers"
 asian_fire_arrow_rocket_infantryDESCR:1 "By the late fourteenth century the secret of manufacturing gunpowder had spread outside China to the Mongols and their vassal states, which also meant that use of fire arrows spread as well.  First used by the Chinese in the tenth century, 'fire arrows' used black powder attached to the body of an arrow inside a hand-held cannon, effectively creating a rocket that could fly a hundred meters or more before striking with incredible force, sometimes tipped with pitch in order to start fires as well.  A hit from a fire arrow was deadly, but the weapons were slow to reload and had to be defended from enemy attacks."
 asian_tower_elephant_cavalry:1 "Tower Elephants"
 asian_tower_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "Elephants continued to hold an important place in Southeast Asian warfare.  However, as enemies became more adept at stopping them, they changed roles from front-line combat to troop carriers and mobile archery towers by constructing wooden towers atop their backs.  Each war elephant could carry as many as a dozen soldiers wielding bows and spears."
 asian_light_cavalry:1 "Light Cavalry"
 asian_light_cavalryDESCR:1 "Seeing the nomads as their primary threat, cavalry became lighter, able to use their speed to catch nomads and force them into battle.  This tactic worked well, as long as the cavalry were numerous enough.  They carried shields to protect them from enemy arrows while approaching, then used halberds, naginata, spears or guan dao swords against the enemy."
 asian_samurai_cavalry:1 "Samurai Heavy Cavalry"
 asian_samurai_cavalryDESCR:1 "As peasant infantry began to pose a greater threat on the battlefield, the samurai warrior caste compensated by replacing their bows with spears, using them to make devastating charges against lines of infantry.  In order to gain more manueverability, they discarded the inflexible o-yoroi armor in favor of more flexible do-maru lamellar favored by heavy infantry."
 asian_yangban_armored_cavalry:1 "Yangban Cavalry"
 asian_yangban_armored_cavalryDESCR:1 "Following the model used for the civil service, military examinations were implemented to choose officers.  Bureaucrats would be tested in horseback archery, use of lances, and knowledge of military and classical texts.  This class of educated gentry (yangban) made for excellent soldiers, both because they were able to serve as professional soldiers and also because they could afford the best quality weapons and armor. They fought from horseback wearing heavy armor and were often stationed in the capital or on the frontiers."
 asian_handgunner_infantry:1 "Handgunners"
 asian_handgunner_infantryDESCR:1 "Known as Shenji Ying in Dai Viet, hand-held guns began to appear in armies as early as the turn of the fourteenth century.  Originally used by the Chinese, they were improved by the addition of an ironwood wad behind the arrow, which helped propel it to an astounding three hundred yards.  These newer versions were used against the Chinese, then by them.  By the middle of the century, one out of every five or six troops carried a firearm of some kind.  They would open fire at the enemy as one before launching regular attacks."
 asian_repeating_crossbow_infantry:1 "Repeating Crossbowmen"
 asian_repeating_crossbow_infantryDESCR:1 "The Zhuge-Nu was a repeating crossbow invented in the fourth century BC.  It allowed even an untrained soldier to fire quarrels quickly at an enemy, giving them a rate of fire unheard of at the time.  In the hands of a trained crossbowman it could fire as many as ten bolts in fifteen seconds!  However, the repeating crossbow was both inaccurate and weak compared to other missile weapons, and as a result was mainly used in siege warfare where range was not an issue, or for untrained conscripts who would fire them en masse.  Despite its limitations, the repeating crossbow saw use in war until the nineteenth century.  It was introduced to Korea as the Sunogung in the fifteenth century."
 asian_five_commands_infantry:1 "Five Commands Infantry"
 asian_five_commands_infantryDESCR:1 "In an attempt to centralize the army, private armies were forcibly attached to the regular army, which was reorganized into five commands, each given authority over one fifth of the nation.  The core of the army were professional troops selected by tests of archery and swordsmanship, supported by ranks of conscript soldiers who were badly trained and equipped.  At the same time, different kinds of fire arrows were tested to come up with improved rockets."
 asian_samurai_infantry:1 "Samurai Heavy Infantry"
 asian_samurai_infantryDESCR:1 "As the Mongol threat receded, the samurai warrior caste began to change their tactics to better suit internal war.  Cavalry was less useful in mountainous terrain, and street fighting in cities forced cavalry onto foot.  These samurai infantry wore more flexible lamellar do-maru armor and carried naginata pole arms, but increasingly they relied on their swords, which were effective at close quarter combat.  As a result, many schools of fencing emerged in this period."
 asian_chong_and_crossbow_infantry:1 "Chong and Crossbowmen"
 asian_chong_and_crossbow_infantryDESCR:1 "Nations that adopted gunpowder weapons expanded against their neighbors which relied on more traditional weaponry.  However, the secrets of these weapons were jealously kept, and it could be difficult and expensive to procure them.  Even the most advanced nations did not maintain armies purely of 'chong' (hand-guns), but instead had elite 'chong and crossbow' units which were attached to larger armies."
 asian_rocketeer_infantry:1 "Rocketeers"
 asian_rocketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "In the mid-sixteenth century, firearms became a standard part of infantry forces, mostly fire arrow rockets.  Rocketeers fought side by side with archers, swordsmen and pikemen.  The majority wore little armor, although officers continued to wear heavy lamellar and metal armor."
 asian_yarigumi_infantry:1 "Yarigumi Spearmen"
 asian_yarigumi_infantryDESCR:1 "As it became apparent that a well-trained force of light infantry could overwhelm aristocratic heavy infantry, infantry were treated with greater respect - especially since they could easily slip over the border and be welcomed into a rival's army.  Over time, the Ashigaru evolved from peasant volunteers into a low-ranking military caste that wore heavier armor and was highly trained in the yari spear.  Unlike samurai spearmen, who used their naginata to thrust at the enemy, Ashigaru used their long spears as pike formations, holding them three rows deep to present enemies with a wall of points that was very effective against cavalry."
 asian_armored_elephant_cavalry:1 "Armored Elephants"
 asian_armored_elephant_cavalryDESCR:1 "As firearms became deadlier on the battlefield, war elephants became targets for the enemy.  In reaction, war elephants wore iron cuirasses to protect them from bullets, although they still needed close-up protection.  This once again placed them in the role of shock troops who could charge at enemy lines to devastating result."

 asian_northern_guard_cavalryDESCR:1 "Heavy cavalry who wore metal armor and carried tridents, spears, glaives and flails which they used with deadly effect from horseback at close range, and composite bows which they fired from long range."
 asian_late_samurai_cavalry:1 "Reformed Samurai Cavalry"
 asian_late_samurai_cavalryDESCR:1 "The introduction of muskets spelled the end of the Samurai on the battlefield.  Unable to charge at enemies armed with the weapon, and unable to cause much damage with bows, heavy cavalry changed tactics.  They relied on front ranks of musketeer infantry to soften up the enemy with volleys of fire, then launched a devastating charge followed by hand to hand combat with spears and occasionally swords.  They wore lamellar armor with metal breastplates to protect them from firearms."
 asian_chong_infantry:1 "Chong Gunners"
 asian_chong_infantryDESCR:1 "Gunpowder weapons became increasingly common.  In addition to the 'chong' hand-guns, elite soldiers were known to make use of 'fire arrow' rockets and officers used signal guns to give orders during the chaos of the battlefield.  However, guns were still not a common weapon, and troops were ordered to count them before and after battle so as not to lose any to the enemy.  The favored tactic was to fire all the chong simultaneously, following it up with a conventional attack."
 asian_mandarin_infantry:1 "Mandarin Infantry"
 asian_mandarin_infantryDESCR:1 "Faced with highly disciplined Wokou pirates who could attack anywhere on one hand, and a large but badly trained and equipped army on the other, general Ch'i Chi-kuang developed the 'Mandarin Duck' squad formation to compensate.  Troops were reorganized into 12-man squads, with each man having a precise role: spearmen to ward off enemy swordsmen, swordsmen to protect the flanks, troops carrying bamboo saplings to entangle the enemy, troops carrying fire lances to guard the rear, and an officer and porter to round out the unit.  The result was a defensive unit that required little training or equipment and could fight independently on the battlefield."
 asian_fire_cart_infantry:1 "Fire Cart Infantry"
 asian_fire_cart_infantryDESCR:1 "Fire arrow rockets were effective weapons, but had a slow reload time that limited the actions of infantry.  As a way to overcome this limitation, the rockets were loaded aboard mobile carts, then fired simultaneously at enemy lines with devastating effect.  This allowed the infantry to carry swords and pole arms, able to charge at the enemy or defend the carts from them while they were reloading.  As a result, rockets regained power on the battlefield.  They were most famously used by the Koreans during the Imjin war, where they were called Hwacha."
 asian_arquebusier_infantry:1 "Harquebusiers"
 asian_arquebusier_infantryDESCR:1 "Compared to bows, European-inspired matchlock muskets required very little training and had very long ranges.  This made them ideal weapons to give to lower class footsoldiers, despite their many disadvantages.  In battle, Arquebusiers stood in lines and used volley tactics to ensure a steady rate of fire against enemy lines.  In between every two arquebusiers, an archer served as a sharpshooter and a spearman wearing laquered or metal armor screened enemy troops.  If an enemy got too close, the arquebusiers would drop their guns and pull out swords instead.  The Japanese used them to great effectiveness in the battle of Nagashino, when 'Teppo Ashigaru' stopped cavalry charges cold."
 asian_hundred_son_infantry:1 "Hundred Son Infantry"
 asian_hundred_son_infantryDESCR:1 "With both sides increasingly making use of chong hand-guns, armies turned to bigger guns to gain the advantage.  Infantry made use of 'big chong' cannons (dachong baizi huoqi) and hundred-son (100-bullet) guns capable of firing dozens of bullets at the enemy in one explosion.  Although these large weapons were cumbersome and not very accurate, they were efficient at crushing revolts and besieging fortresses."
 asian_wagon_infantry:1 "Wagon Infantry"
 asian_wagon_infantryDESCR:1 "Nomad horsemen were difficult to fight with slow-moving infantry, and could attack at any time.  One novel tactic to overcome this problem was to group infantry into small units, each centered around a wagon.  Twenty men would march, while a two-wheeled war wagon would carry two light artillery pieces and a team of ten men to operate them.  Four of this team would also carry European-style matchlock muskets that could strike at a distance.  This system allowed the army to bring the advantage of gunpowder with them wherever they went."
 asian_samsubyong_infantry:1 "Three Combat Forces"
 asian_samsubyong_infantryDESCR:1 "Long experience fighting the Wokou pirates led to the development of new tactics and weapons, culminating in the publishing of the manual 'New Book of Practical Tactics'.  Armies based on this new way of fighting were called the Three Combat Forces (Samsubyong), since they were divided into three corps: archers, swordsmen, and musketeers using sungja, or 'victory guns'.  At the same time, the feudal system of requiring peasants to serve in the army was being replaced with feudal taxation that paid for a professional class of soldiers.  Together, the new army represented a dynamic new force capable of dealing with any kind of opponent."
 asian_banner_infantry:1 "Banner Infantry"
 asian_banner_infantryDESCR:1 "The Eight Banner system reorganized the entire population into military units and supporting households, disrupting the old tribal hierarchies that had previously dominated.  The new army was not only larger, but also more loyal to the central government."
 asian_musketeer_infantry:1 "Musketeers"
 asian_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Matchlock muskets were inaccurate and slow weapons, but they had excellent range.  With well-trained soldiers and extra muskets, a troop of musketeers could stop a cavalry charge, as they proved at the battle of Nagashino.  At the same time, armies found various ways to compensate for the biggest weakness of matchlock muskets - the need to keep the matches dry.  Matches began to be chemically treated to be weatherproof, and some muskets had protective boxes to keep water out.  From an initial ratio of two guns to one pole arm, by the end of the sixteenth century Musketeers had adopted a ratio of four to one, relying mainly on their swords if an enemy reached their lines."
 asian_war_elephant_artillery_cavalry:1 "Artillery Elephants"
 asian_war_elephant_artillery_cavalryDESCR:1 "With the arrival of firearms, specialized elephant corps were formed armed with swivel guns on their backs, attended by two soldiers, in addition to the usual driver and musketeer.  Elephants continued to be screened by infantry to protect them, although they were rarely hurt by musket balls."
 asian_horse_guard_cavalry:1 "Horse Guard"
 asian_horse_guard_cavalryDESCR:1 "Samurai cavalry were well trained and heavily armored, but were also sometimes difficult to control due to their pride and personal codes of honor.  In the sixteenth century, they began to be replaced with professional troops known as Horse Guards.  Heavily armed and armored, they were made up of lower-class troops loyal to their commander.  At first they played the role of elite bodyguards, but as time went on, began to make up large parts of the cavalry, until finally they supplanted them entirely."
 asian_dragoon_cavalry:1 "Dragoons"
 asian_dragoon_cavalryDESCR:1 "Nomad horsemen were difficult to fight, able to pick the time and place of battles and more numerous than regular cavalry forces.  In order to deal with this threat, the role of cavalry changed into dragoons - mounted infantry who could reach the battlefield quickly, but then fight on foot.  This placed the infantry in the role of stopping cavalry charges, while the cavalry made sure the infantry held."
 asian_forbidden_soldier_cavalry:1 "Forbidden Soldiers"
 asian_forbidden_soldier_cavalryDESCR:1 "Attempts to divide the country into military districts under the authority of different armies worked well in peacetime, but badly when threatened with invasion.  This system was replaced with a permanent, salaried force of cavalry based in the capital.  Each unit would be filled with peasants from villages near the capital in order to foster a sense of cohesion, and to avoid the corrupting influence of the city."
 asian_new_guard_infantry:1 "New Guard"
 asian_new_guard_infantryDESCR:1 "Infantry tended to wear whatever armor they could afford, or more often, whatever their lord could afford.  Because of this, feudal infantry wore a wide variety of armor.  A national army paid for by a central government was different: it consisted of low class guardsmen who owed their loyalty to the state, and who had standardized arms, armor and uniforms provided."
 asian_matchlock_musketeer_infantry:1 "Matchlock Musketeers"
 asian_matchlock_musketeer_infantryDESCR:1 "Trade with European nations brought their muskets to the attention of Asia - sometimes against them on the battlefield.  Using captured muskets or European adventurers, armies began experimenting with European-style weapons and liked what they saw.  Casting aside Chinese hand-guns in favor of the more accurate muskets, entire regiments of musketeers were trained.  These musketeers relied on swords for self-defense rather than screens of spearmen.   Although they often used European weaponry to begin with, it was not long before domestic imitations were produced, and then improved on.  At the same time, they continued to supplement firearms with rockets."
 asian_charge_infantry:1 "Charge Infantry"
 asian_charge_infantryDESCR:1 "With large armies of unreliable troops, the solution was obvious: officers and their bodyguards, all chosen for their fighting ability, led the army from the front lines.  These men swore oaths to die before fleeing, and their desperate charges not only threw enemies into disarray, they also inspired less reliable troops to stand and fight.  Although these charge tactics helped win victories, they also prevented generals from employing more subtle tactics and manuevers."
 asian_green_standard_infantry:1 "Green Standard Infantry"
 asian_green_standard_infantryDESCR:1 "Enemy troops often came from low social status and were paid so badly they could not afford families.  Attracted by the promise of regular pay, many took the opportunity to switch sides and sign up for long enlistments.  Bringing with them mastery of gunpowder weapons, they were eagerly embraced as an army within the army - the Green Standard Army."
 asian_volley_infantry:1 "Volley Fire Musketeers"
 asian_volley_infantryDESCR:1 "During the thirty years war, Sweden's king Gustavus Adolphus revolutionized warfare by training his musketeers vigorously in a new tactic. Instead of using countermarch tactics, the troops were trained to stand in three lines so that at any time one line was kneeling, one line was crouching, and one line was firing at the enemy. This demanded an incredible level of discipline and training to accomplish, making Swedish troops some of the most professional in the world. In addition, regiments were reduced from 3,000 men to a mere 500, making them more manueverable on the battlefield."
 asian_platoon_infantry:1 "Platoon Fire Muskeeters"
 asian_platoon_infantryDESCR:1 "Bayonets were introduced in the mid-seventeenth century and were gradually refined and made more reliable.  Throughout the seventeenth century tactics remained the same: musketeers advanced slowly on the enemy, pausing to fire volleys at them in an attempt to break the enemy line, allowing cavalry to pursue and mop up the scattered enemy.  When this failed, a bayonet charge and hand-to-hand combat was necessary.  This tactic gradually made pikemen superflous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  Scottish Highlanders were known for being willing to charge the enemy just as much as shoot at them."

This tactic gradually made pikemen superflous on the battlefield, and where there had been three pikemen to every musketeer by the beginning of the century, there were five musketeers to every pikemen by its end.  British Redcoats used their bayonets to keep the enemy at bay while picking them off with musket fire."
 asian_carabinier_cavalry:1 "Carabiniers"
 asian_carabinier_cavalryDESCR:1 "The Carabiniers first came into being in the late sixteenth century and were a type of heavy cavalry that had many things in common with Cuirassiers. They also wore protective armour, though slightly less then a Cuirassier. The main difference between the two cavalry forces was their armament. A Carabinier's main weapon was the carbine, a short wheellock handgun. In addition to the carbine, they were also armed with a sword."
 asian_armeblanche_cavalry:1 "Arme Blanche Cavalry"
 asian_armeblanche_cavalryDESCR:1 "While the hussar Cavalry represented the balance between fire and shock and the Dragoon cavalry relied primarily on their muskets, Arme Blanche cavalry relied primarily on cold steel. The bold charges of these units could shatter enemy formations."
 asian_mediumhussar_cavalry:1 "Medium Hussars"
 asian_mediumhussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Armored Knights remained the predominant form of cavalry in Western Europe long after other parts of the world had moved towards more mobile light cavalry.  At the battle of Adrianople, the cream of Western European nobility met the Ottoman light cavalry and was soundly defeated by their superior mobility.  In comparison, the Hungarians and Poles used lighter cavalry called Hussars that had more success.  Forced to confront this new reality, Western European armies began to adopt Polish Winged Hussar cavalry in place of the aristocratic knights."
 asian_bayonet_infantry:1 "Bayonet Infantry"
 asian_bayonet_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century, and soon new tactics were developed to suit.  Now that musketeers had reliable bayonets, infantry charges were once again a viable strategy in battle, allowing them to once again claim the initiative on the battlefield."
 asian_line_infantry:1 "Line Infantry"
 asian_line_infantryDESCR:1 "The use of volley tactics, the introduction of safer, more reliable flintlock muskets and the use of bayonets in close combat eliminated the need for pikemen on the battlefield by the turn of the eighteenth century.  Soon afterwards, new tactics were developed to suit this reality.  The most popular and arguably most effective tactic was to form a thin line facing the enemy so that musketeers could inflict maximum casualties on the enemy and react quickly to enemy movement. This also allowed for specialized soldiers to appear along the line such as the grenadier."
 asian_skirmisher_infantry:1 "Irregular Skirmishers"
 asian_skirmisher_infantryDESCR:1 "Standing armies were small, and even in the seventeenth century levies were called upon during wartime to make up the bulk of the army. These conscript troops did not have the training or discipline of regulars and were often distrusted by their commanders. With more accurate and faster guns making pike screens unnecessary, some commanders began using these men as irregular infantry who operated as marksmen and skirmishers in small units around the main army. These irregular skirmishers could help scout unfamiliar terrain, pin down enemy units until the main force could arrive, and best of all, were expendible. Austria in particular made great use of their 'Grenzers', who made up over a quarter of the Austrian army."
 asian_hunter_cavalry:1 "Hunter Cavalry"
 asian_hunter_cavalryDESCR:1 "Hunter cavalry were lightly armored units trained for rapid action.  They specialized in skirmishes and were renowned for their shooting skills.  They proved so useful during the shifting lines of battle that the French army developed these 'Chasseur de Cheval' into a significant part of their cavalry."
 asian_uhlan_cavalry:1 "Uhlans"
 asian_uhlan_cavalryDESCR:1 "The first Uhlans were created in the early eighteenth century Century. They were used primarily for reconnaissance for the more heavily armored cavalry, as well as being assigned to skirmishes. Later on they became an essential part of the military structure due to their light armor, making them fast and agile on the battlefield, and for their high shock value against their enemies.  Uhlan cavalry were a good alternative to large infantry armies as they were not only heavy hitting but also more cost effective. This allowed smaller nations with less manpower to actually put up an effective fight, as armies on foot were also slower compared to their mounted counterparts."
 asian_lighthussar_cavalry:1 "Light Hussars"
 asian_lighthussar_cavalryDESCR:1 "As Cavalry became more specialised, the Hussar started to evolve. The Hussar unit became less like the heavy Polish Hussar and more like the light Hungarian original. The ability of these light and mobile troops to find the enemy, harrass them, and overrun their artillery more than made up for their lack of armor."
 asian_drill_infantry:1 "Drill Infantry"
 asian_drill_infantryDESCR:1 "Able to fight at close range or from further away, musketeers were versatile indeed - but only if they could react quickly to the shifting battlefield. Frederick of Prussia trained his men rigorously to deal with any situation that could conceivably come up until they became an incredible fighting force that never broke ranks and could fire as much as one shot every fifteen seconds under combat conditions!  This Prussian Drill infantry became the model army for the rest of the world after its stunning successes in battle and was used by both sides in the American Revolution."
 asian_mass_infantry:1 "Mass Infantry"
 asian_mass_infantryDESCR:1 "A favorite of the Russians, highly drilled Mass Infantry could be relied on to charge while under fire without breaking, resulting in terrible casualities for the enemy if it succeeded in reaching enemy lines. The bayonet and constant drill brought back the charge tactic in force: mass infantry launched a devastating volley of fire at their enemy, then set their bayonets and charged.  The result could be deadly to their enemies when it succeeded - or deadly to their own side if it failed."
 asian_rifled_infantry:1 "Rifled Muskeeters"
 asian_rifled_infantryDESCR:1 "Smooth-bore firearms like the musket were notoriously inaccurate, often off by more than a foot at fifty yards.  This meant that musketeers had to fight in tight groups that were vulnerable to increasingly deadly artillery fire. The solution was to introduce rifled muskets that added spin to a bullet and made it fly straight, making these 'rifles' much more accurate and deadly at ranges where a regular musket would be completely ineffective. The downside was that reloading such a gun was time-consuming - a rifle could get off only one shot for every three musket balls - so riflemen were trained to fight in pairs, one shooting while the other reloaded. Although rifles had been put into use by the late eighteenth century, their cost and disadvantages made them relatively rare until much later.  Riflemen such as the Prussian Jaegers or British Greenjackets made excellent sharpshooters and snipers, but because they fought in smaller groups were unable to protect themselves from cavalry.  Most armies maintained small numbers of riflemen in each brigade to compensate for each other's weaknesses."
 asian_columnar_infantry:1 "Columnar Infantry"
 asian_columnar_infantryDESCR:1 "Revolutionary France relied on conscript soldiers for the bulk of their army. To give these green troops confidence in battle they placed them in a single column that marched steadily forward towards the enemy to the beat of hundreds of drums. The column presented a thin target that could turn to form a line or dig in to entrenchments that protected them from enemy attack.  The men in front would be killed by enemy fire, but eventually the men would climb over the bodies of their own dead and break through enemy lines.  Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."
 asian_impulse_infantry:1 "Impulse Infantry"
 asian_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 asian_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lancers"
 asian_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 asian_breech_infantry:1 "Breech Loaded Riflemen"
 asian_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breach-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breach-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
 steppes_swarm_cavalry:1 "Swarm Cavalry"
 steppes_swarm_cavalryDESCR:1 "Under the system perfected by Ghengis Khan, every man between the ages of 15 and 60 served in the army in return for a share of the loot.  Formed into decimal units of horsemen, the armies were highly flexible.  Most fought as light cavalry or horse archers, specializing in a feigned retreat ('mangudai') that could go on for days until heavy cavalry could ambush and encircle the enemy in a swarm.  Most wore heavy coats and silk shirts that could stop arrows and carried swords, daggers and composite bows made from yak horns.  In the south, these horse archers were known as Tirkash-band."
 steppes_spear_infantry:1 "Spear Infantry"
 steppes_spear_infantryDESCR:1 "After their initial conquests, the Mongols began accepting surrendered enemies into their armies as auxillaries and besiegers, especially those with knowledge of siege machinery or gunpowder.  These troops fought with a variety of weapons including spears, axes and crossbows.  When available, they also used hand-held 'fire arrow' rockets against the enemy.   Most fought for a share of the loot, or in return for fiefs, rather than for pay.  The Han Chun armies of Yuan China were a good example of this style of warfare."
 steppes_sarbardar_militia_infantry:1 "Sarbardar Militia"
 steppes_sarbardar_militia_infantryDESCR:1 "By the fourteenth century, Mongol soldiers were paid a modest salary in exchange for their service.  This allowed them to maintain urban militia forces which provided defence against invaders and were invaluable during the sieges of enemy cities.  They wore light armor but carried spears, crossbows and rockets which they used in battle.  Timur made good use of them during his conquest of Transoxiana."
 steppes_archer_infantry:1 "Archers"
 steppes_archer_infantryDESCR:1 "Influenced by the Muslim warriors they encountered, Tatar footsoldiers wore mail hauberks and carried shields and sabres, but their weapon of choice continued to be their traditional compound bows.  At the same time, they eagerly adopted gunpowder weapons.  Some soldiers carried metal pipes that sealed at one end and lit them to fire shot or arrows at the enemy."
 steppes_heavy_swarm_cavalry:1 "Heavy Swarm Cavalry"
 steppes_heavy_swarm_cavalryDESCR:1 "The core of the army was ethnic tribes who agreed to send men to fight in return for tax-exempt status for the tribe and fiefs (suyurghal) for the men.  What made them better than earlier armies was the brutal discipline imposed on the men and the increasing share of the army devoted to heavy cavalry.  The discipline allowed commanders to order rapid changes and frequent attacks on the enemy, and the heavier armor made charges more effective.  To take advantage of these two advantages, the army was divided into eight or more autonomous parts, rather than the traditional three."
 steppes_divani_swarm_cavalry:1 "Divani Swarm Cavalry"
 steppes_divani_swarm_cavalryDESCR:1 "The weapons and tactics of Mongol armies remained static for centuries.  However, the organization of their armies changed radically.

 steppes_heavy_infantry:1 "Heavy Infantry"
 steppes_heavy_infantryDESCR:1 "Reflecting Muslim influence, fifteenth century Tatar infantry wore heavy mail-and-plate armor and carried sabres as their weapon of choice.  They also carried bows and crossbows, as well as the occasional gunpowder rocket."
 steppes_tumandar_cavalry:1 "Tumandar Cavalry"
 steppes_tumandar_cavalryDESCR:1 "With increasingly sophisticated economies came better access to metal armor. By the end of the fifteenth century, Mongol cavalry wore high quality armor including helmets, cuirasses, plated vambraces and mail and plate.  Their primary weapons were the same sabres and bows of their ancestors, although they also carried spears and maces.  This allowed them not only to harass the enemy, but also protect the flanks.  Despite this, Mongol cavalry continued to prefer to fight from long range, launching a massed volley of arrows against enemy formations with devastating effect."
 steppes_handgunner_infantry:1 "Hand-Gunners"
 steppes_handgunner_infantryDESCR:1 "Tatar troops carried sabres for hand-to-hand combat, but increasingly relied upon gunpowder harquebus weapons in combat.  In urban warfare, they took advantage of wooden palisades to find cover and made use of a large hook-gun ('zatinnaya pishal') to fire six-foot-long iron arrows at enemies under cover."
 steppes_yikitlar_cavalry:1 "Yikitlar Braves"
 steppes_yikitlar_cavalryDESCR:1 "Sixteenth century Mongols wore lamellar cuirasses and carried shields and sabres, but fought with both bows and matchlock muskets.  In addition to the feigned retreats and swarm tactics the Mongols were famous for, Yikitlar 'braves' used the novel tactic of attacking while cavalry wings supported them.  They were famously used by Babur in his conquest of Delhi."
 steppes_banner_infantry:1 "Bannermen"
 steppes_banner_infantryDESCR:1 "The Banner system reorganized the entire population into military units and supporting households, disrupting the old tribal hierarchies that had previously dominated.  The new army was not only larger, but also more loyal to the central government.  The Banners also allowed different ethnic groups to serve in separate units.  The Manchu Eight Banner Army proved its effectiveness when they conquered China."
 steppes_firelock_cavalry:1 "Firelock Cavalry"
 steppes_firelock_cavalryDESCR:1 "By the late sixteenth century, the Mongols had replaced their bows with carbines.  They maintained their distance from the enemy, preferring to avoid charges and hand-to-hand combat in favor of firing pistols at range and skirmishing."
 steppes_raid_cavalry:1 "Raid Cavalry"
 steppes_raid_cavalryDESCR:1 "Faced with artillery and muskets, Mongol armies found it difficult to maintain the cohesion and momentum required for their traditional tactics.  Instead, they hung back from open battle, harassing the enemy from a distance and preventing them from concentrating their fire.  While the enemy force was distracted by this, small units would break off from the Mongol army to raid deep into the now-unprotected enemy territory, or Mongol rulers would negotiate the defection of key enemy units."

Although losses could be high, columns often won against other formations through sheer stubbornness and force of numbers."

 steppes_impulse_infantryDESCR:1 "Impulse Infantry relied upon a 'cloud' of light infantry that acted as sharpshooters and skirmishers, keeping the enemy pinned down under fire while the main line advanced into position to charge the enemy line and deliver a coup de grace."
 steppes_lancer_cavalry:1 "Lancers"
 steppes_lancer_cavalryDESCR:1 "The creme de la creme of the Napoleonic army. Although their lances made them less agile these cavalry troops were formidable adversaries when charging their enemies directly."
 steppes_breech_infantry:1 "Breech Loaded Riflemen"
 steppes_breech_infantryDESCR:1 "Nearly all early firearms were muzzle-loaded, or loaded from the front. This made even the more advanced guns slow to reload, a critical factor in battle. The first mass-produced breach-loader (back-loaded guns) began appearing in the nineteenth century and made combat much deadlier. Where before a well-trained soldier could fire as many as four shots a minute, even a poorly trained soldier could fire faster with a breach-loaded rifle.  This had the effect of making a single soldier much deadlier than ever before."
