 immortals:1 "The Immortals"
 immortals_desc:1 "The Zhayedan were an elite unit within the cataphracts.  Given only the finest weaponry and armour and riding the famed Nisean horses, they fought with such ferocity and skill that their glittering coats of mail and gleaming cuirasses were said to break the enemy's morale simply by showing up to the battlefield."
