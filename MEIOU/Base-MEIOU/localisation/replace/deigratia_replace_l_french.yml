 PATRIARCH_DESCRIPTION:1 "Les souverains ont toujours eu une relation étroite avec le clergé, ce qui ne veut pas dire une relation amicale. D'un côté, le clergé était habituellement exempt de payer les taxes, possédait une grande quantité de terres et de biens, et pouvait même critiquer le dirigeant. D'un autre côté, il pouvait maintenir satisfaite la population  et aider à éradiquer l'hérésie. Quand l'influence cléricale augmente, le revenu fiscal de l'État diminue mais le risque de révolte baisse et des missionnaires sont octroyés. (Le nombre de missionnaire affiché est arrondi au nombre entier le plus proche et vous n'en recevrez un de plus que lorsque vous l'atteindrez réellement).\n\nA nation's church influence is set in the background and may take up to 5 years to reflect changes.  It begins at a base of §G20%§! and is influenced by many factors:\n•Church property adds up to §G60%§! (less §R10%§! if they pay taxes and another §R10%§! if your ruler is head of the state religion or otherwise controls investiture); most countries begin the game with half this, modified by type of country.\n•Being a theocracy adds §G20%§!.\n•Having a religious form of education can increase it by up to §G10%§!, while having a secular education system can reduce it by up to §R10%§!.\n•Having monasticism in your country adds §G5%§! (if you keep rejecting it, eventually this - and the monks - will go away).\n•Having a theologian advisor temporarily adds §G5%§!, while an inquisitor advisor adds §G10%§!.\n•Choosing to support your state religion financially (a mid-game decision) adds §G10%§!.\n\nSome religions also have unique mechanics:\n•Muslims who support Sufis and Ulema can add up to §G10%§! for each, while having influence or control over the Caliph lowers it by up to §R10%§!.\n•Some Church Aspects for Protestants (celibate priests, guided interpretation) add §G5%§! each, while others (civil unions, appointed bishops and free membership) can lower it by §R10%§! each.\n•The Hindu Bhakti Movement decreases Church Influence by §R10%§!.\n•Mahayana Buddhists can lower their influence by §R10%§! for banning a school or allowing any religion.\n•Calixtines automatically lose §R10%§! for being anti-institutional.\n•Jews gain §G5%§! for re-establishing the Levite priesthood and §G10%§! for reestablishing the Sanhedrin."

 PIETY_DESCRIPTION:1 "§WLa piété représente la dévotion religieuse de notre nation. En plus des effets explicites de la piété, elle affecte aussi de nombreux événements religieux, décisions et modificateurs. Une piété élevée (fanatisme) vous donnera plus et de plus conséquents événements religieux, alors qu'une piété faible (sécularisme) vous donnera moins et de moins importants événements religieux. \n\n Vous pouvez connaitre votre piété actuelle par ses effets : +100% de piété vous octroie +1 de tolérance envers votre propre foi, tandis que -100% vous en donne -1.\n\n La piété d'une nation est revue en arrière-plan et pourrait prendre jusqu'à 5 ans pour refléter les changements. Divers facteurs l'influencent, notamment : \n• le gouvernement: §G+20§! pour une théocratie, §G+10§! pour une monarchie médiévale, §G+10§! pour un gouvernement tribal, §R-10§! pour un gouvernement éclairé, §R-10§! pour une république (cumulatif).\n• les doctrines: §G+40§! pour chaque groupe doctrinal religieux complet, §R-40§! pour les doctrines humanistes, §R-20§! pour les doctrines ploutocratiques, novatrices, d'espionnage, commerciales ou diplomatiques.\n• la tolérance religieuse: §G+10§! pour l'intolérance religieuse, §R-10§! pour la tolérance religieuse, §R-10§! pour tolérer des minorités religieuses.\n• les conseillers: §R-10§! pour un philosophe ou un scientifique.\n• avoir une controverse religieuse: §G+10§!\n• la relation avec les infidèles: §G+10§! pour un pays frontalier infidèle, §G+10§! pour être en guerre avec un ennemi religieux, §R-10§! pour être allié avec un pays infidèle.\n• le système d'éducation: de §R-10§! à §G+10§!."

 CALL_CRUSADENEWDESC:1 "Do you wish to call for a Crusade against $COUNTRY$?\n\nThe stronger the pope's authority (shown in the papal controller modifier), the more countries will be eligible to join the crusade.  When a pope's authority is too weak, crusades will not grant a casus belli at all.  As the pope's authority increases (from having more and more pious Catholic nations owning more Catholic provinces), Catholic countries in good standing with the church will be granted a casus belli, beginning next to the target and spreading as the pope's authority increases, or as their own piety increases.  Catholic countries will also get some bonuses while fighting a crusade depending on their piety.\n\nThe papal controller may choose to call one crusade at a time using diplomatic options, but may also be given the chance to call a crusade by event if a Christian nation calls for help."

 shinto_religion_desc:1 "Shintoism is the original Animist religion of Japan.  It teaches that the world is inhabited by spirits, from minor nature spirits to powerful gods.  With the coming of Buddhism, Shinto was relegated to a secondary religion in Japan, with Shinto shrines administered by Buddhist temples.  However, it remained a popular folk religion and would later be used to help justify Emperor Meiji seizing power directly in the nineteenth century."

Since then, they have always dreamed of returning to Jerusalem."
 
 chaldean_religion_desc:1 "The Assyrian Church of the East represents non-Roman Christianity.  Spread by the Apostles who went east into Persia, the Church - sometimes called Chaldeans - spread through the Middle East and into Asia.  Without state support it gradually died out in many places, leaving behind beautiful churches and haunting graveyards.  They share several key belief with Nestorians but predate them by centuries."
 hussite_religion_desc:1 "English Lollards and Bohemian Hussites both condemned the Catholic Church for its greed, believing the Church should return to the first days of Christianity and practise Apostolic Poverty.  They also both agreed on the importance of allowing ordinary worshippers to partake from the Chalice at Eucharist, from where the name Calixtine originates."
 gnostic_religion_desc:1 "From its earliest days, Christianity has been split by disagreements over basic theology, especially over which books belonged in the Bible.  Gnostic Christians believed they were privy to secret knowledge about Christ which helped them understand His teachings better.  Many believed that God had created the Spiritual world, while the Devil was in charge of the Physical.  For this and other beliefs they were persecuted by their fellow Christians, but time and time again a Gnostic heresy would emerge again.  The most recent were the Bogomils of the Balkans and the Cathars of France and Italy."
 catholic_religion_desc:1 "Catholics believe in an unbroken line of succession from Jesus Christ through Saint Peter to the Bishops of Rome, the Pope.  From him comes the authority for Church bishops, making Catholicism one of the most hierarchical of religions.  Having developed out of Roman Christianity, the Catholic Church spread across Western Europe and from there to the lands dominated by the many nations there.  This has resulted it in facing many challenges to its authority over the centuries, from regional heresies to military force.  Needing to deal with these challenges has made the Church reluctant to change, even when it is sometimes needed."
 coptic_religion_desc:1 "Miaphysite Christianity descends from Roman Christianity in Egypt and the Middle East, splitting off from the Roman Church over the issue of Christ's Nature and Church Leadership.  Having suffered under Muslim rule, the ancient Patriarch-Catholicates of Antioch, Jerusalem and Alexandria are still important centres of Miaphysite theology, but the heartlands of the faith have moved on to places like Ethiopia and Armenia."
 orthodox_religion_desc:1 "Eastern Orthodox Christians consider themselves to hold to the beliefs of the original Roman Christians.  Unlike the Catholic Church, Orthodox Churches acknowledge the primacy of the original five Patriarchs of the Roman Church: Alexandria, Antioch, Constantinople, Jerusalem and Rome.  However, they also place Orthodox rulers at the head of each Church."
 protestant_religion_desc:1 "Protestantism is an umbrella religion which includes dozens of different denominations united in their opposition to Catholicism.  Born in the Protestant Reformation, most are state churches which agree that the Bible should be used to justify doctrine, that the King, not the Pope, has authority over the Church, and that faith alone will save Christians."
 reformed_religion_desc:1 "The Reformed Church includes Calvinists, Presbyterians and other radical Reformers who split off from the Western Church during the Protestant Reformation.  Inspired by theologians like Zwingli and Calvin, Reformed Christians demanded a personal relationship with God, who being all-powerful and all-knowing has already decided whether each of us is saved or not."
 
 zoroastrian_religion_desc:1 "Famous for its reverence for the eternal flames found in Zoroastrian temples, and for their unusual method of burying the dead, Zoroastrianism is one of the first monotheistic religions.  The Prophet Zoroaster stamped out worship of the many nature gods in ancient Persia, where he found royal support.  The religion prospered for many centuries before going into a steep decline after the Islamic conquest.  Zoroaster described the god Ahura Mazda, who was in a constant struggle to defeat evil, and how everyone must live a moral life to avoid an eternal punishment after death and be rewarded instead."
 sikhism_religion_desc:1 "Sikhism emerged in India as the result of internecine warfare between Hindus and Muslims.  The Guru Nanak attempted to bridge the two and bring people together, but due to persecution his movement changed from a peaceful one into a militant order."
 hinduism_religion_desc:1 "Hinduism is a modern term for the mixture of polytheistic Vedic gods of the Aryans and the nature worship of the Indus Valley.  Over thousands of years, this religion has become synonymous with India.  It is very pluralistic, allowing worshippers to worship as many gods as they wish or only one, with many villages and towns having their own gods and own festivals concerning them.  Despite this, all Hindus share certain beliefs.  After death, souls are reborn into new bodies in an endless cycle known as Samsara.  Your karma in this life helps determine your station in life in the next, with every Hindu born into one of four castes, each of which carries unique sacred duties to fulfil in order to gain good karma, or excluded entirely as an 'untouchable'.  Because of this belief, many Hindus are vegetarian, and treat animals kindly - especially cows, who are believed to display the qualities all Hindus must ascribe to: selflessness, non-violence, and gentleness."
 jain_religion_desc:1 "Jainism emerged in India and bears many similarities to early Hinduism.  Jains believe in reincarnation, in karma, and in a caste system.  They also celebrate several of the same festivals, have monastic orders, practise Ahimsa (non-violence) and are vegetarian, leading to a close relationship between Jainism and Hinduism.  However, Jainism rejects the Vedas as revelation and even rejects the idea of a creator god, instead emphasising meditation and asceticism.  Jainism is divided into two sects, the Digambara (Sky Clad) and Svetambara (White Clad), who disagree on which teachings of their founder are legitimate, whether women can achieve liberation, and whether monks should be naked."
 buddhism_religion_desc:1 "Theravada Buddhism sprang out of India, where Prince Siddharta became the Buddha in the fifth century BCE when he rejected both asceticism and desire and found a Middle Way to enlightenment.  He emphasised how attachment caused suffering, and how all things were impermanent.  By following his teachings (Dharma), his followers could reach a state of enlightenment known as Nirvana, breaking the cycle of death and rebirth.  After his death, Buddhism spread south into Sri Lanka and east into Indochina, where it took firm root.  The followers of Theravada Buddhism rely on the Pali Canon for religious and legal guidance and emphasis is put on monasticism as part of personal enlightenment.  Many Theravada monks go around begging for sustenance as they attempt to meditate on the nature of reality."
 vajrayana_religion_desc:1 "Vajrayana Buddhism represents Tibetan Buddhism.  Buddhism reached Tibet from the south (Theravada Buddhism) and east (Mahayana Buddhism), mixing with Tantrism to become a new branch of Buddhism that emphasises that enlightenment is difficult to achieve by one's own self, but must instead be taught by teachers.  To this end, Vajrayana Buddhism emphasises Bodhisattvas, or living Buddhas who once achieved enlightenment but then consciously decided to be reborn again so that they could continue to teach their followers, with each Bodhisattva leading his own sect of Vajrayana Buddhism.  The most famous Bodhisattva is the Dalai Lama, who leads the Gelug (Yellow Hat) sect, but there are many others as well."
 mahayana_religion_desc:1 "As Buddhism spread into East Asia, it mixed with local traditions and philosophies such as Confucianism, Taoism and Shinto, growing into something more: the Mahayana ('Great Wheel') school.  Mahayana Buddhism offers its followers not only the Pali Canon followed by all Buddhists, but also other Sutras said to be later teachings of the Buddha such as the Heart Sutra and Lotus Sutra.  Mahayana Buddhism also emphasises that enlightened Buddhas such as Kwannon (Guanyin) can assume any form they wish to help liberate people from ignorance, leading them to be sometimes venerated the way gods are in other religions.  It is divided into many competing sects, each with a different emphasis.  All have organised orders of monks."
 confucianism_religion_desc:1 "Confucianism is the term for the philosophies of fifth century BCE philosopher Confucius and stresses personal development and the importance of good government."
 
 shiite_religion_desc:1 "Shia Muslims hold that the legitimate successor of the prophet Muhammad as Caliph and Imam was his cousin and son-in-law Ali. The Shiites believe that a number of Imams have followed Ali and still await the coming of his final successor."
 sunni_religion_desc:1 "Sunni Muslims claim to be the original followers of the Prophet Muhammad.  They follow his teachings as written in the Qu'ran and interpreted in the Hadiths by Islamic scholars and jurists.  Sunni Islam is relatively tolerant of different beliefs as long as they are monotheistic and do not contradict Islam.  In theory, Sunni Muslims follow a single leader, the Caliph ('successor'), but in practise this ended long ago when the Caliphate split into many Sultanates."
 ibadi_religion_desc:1 "Ibadism is claimed by its adherents to be older than both Sunni and Shia Islam but is nowhere near as popular. The Ibadis stress strict adherence to an interpretation of Islam and the Sharia that they hold as both older and more orthodox."
 wahhabi_religion_desc:1 "Wahhabiism is the latest incarnation of Kharjite Islam.  A nationalist Arab sect of Islam, it preaches a return to the fundamentals of the faith when the Caliphate was united and strong.  According to its beliefs, Islam lost its way when it split apart and began incorporating ideas from other faiths.  Now it is time for a renewal of faith."
 druze_religion_desc:1 "Druze follow a monotheistic Abrahamic religion that split off from Islam several hundred years before the game begins.  A unitarian belief, it is not recognisable as Muslim and instead shares beliefs with Greek Philosophy, Hinduism, Christianity and Islam.  The Druze themselves are fairly isolationist and prefer to be left alone."

Those who share a totem animal form clans, and consider one-another family.\nIn the game Totemism is the state religion of all North American Native states and it is present in most of the North American continent."

While the Pantheon and many concepts are quite similar to the Mayan religion the Nahua or Aztecs assigns a much higher importance on the need for human sacrifice in order to survive each new cosmic cycle.\nIn the game most of the area around modern central Mexico starts out with Nahuatl religion."
