 republic.001.t:1 "The Republic of $COUNTRY$"
 republic.001.d:1 "During the Renaissance, most countries had patchworks of laws and regulations rather than a single uniform code. This was especially true of republics, which, at least in theory, worked on the principle of representation of their populations, and which used trading privileges and voting rights to sway colonies and conquered cities to their side. A $MONARCHTITLE$ who granted rights and privileges to his people might be weaker than a king, but he could win the loyalty of the people more easily."
 republic.001.a:1 "I understand."
 republic.002.t:1 "The Charter of $PROVINCECAPITAL$"
 republic.002.d:1 "Now that we have added $PROVINCENAME$ to the republic, we must decide how to treat it. If we grant it the same rights and privileges our people have become accustomed to, we may win their hearts and minds - to say nothing of their support in the next election! On the other hand, if we rule over them with an iron fist, it will give the $MONARCHTITLE$ more personal power, but at the cost of alienating republican supporters in $COUNTRY$."
 republic.002.a:1 "Promise them complete autonomy."
 republic.002.b:1 "Promise them great autonomy."
 republic.002.c:1 "Promise them some autonomy."
 republic.002.e:1 "Grant them limited autonomy."
 republic.002.f:1 "Crush the local government and rule them from $CAPITAL_CITY$!"
 total_autonomy:1 "Independent City"
 desc_total_autonomy:1 "This city has been granted practical independence in return for its loyalty to our nation. It behaves as a trading partner and ally, but not as a subject of our ruler."
 high_autonomy:1 "Autonomous City"
 desc_high_autonomy:1 "This city has been granted autonomy in return for its loyalty. It acts in its own interests when they do not conflict with that of our state."
 moderate_autonomy:1 "Semi-Autonomous City"
 desc_moderate_autonomy:1 "This city has been granted extensive rights and privileges, which sometimes results in conflict between it and the national government."
 low_autonomy:1 "City Charter"
 desc_low_autonomy:1 "This city has been granted certain rights and privileges in order to keep it happy."
 remove_autonomy_total_title:1 "Revoke Autonomy"
 remove_autonomy_total_desc:1 "Once granted, it was difficult to withdraw rights from a city. Its people quickly became accustomed to their autonomy and would fight to keep them - in parliament, or when that failed, by force of arms. However, a ruler who wanted to centralize the state paid little heed to such complaints."
 remove_autonomy_high_title:1 "Revoke Autonomy"
 remove_autonomy_high_desc:1 "Once granted, it was difficult to withdraw rights from a city. Its people quickly became accustomed to their autonomy and would fight to keep them - in parliament, or when that failed, by force of arms.

 remove_autonomy_low_desc:1 "Once granted, it was difficult to withdraw rights from a city. Its people quickly became accustomed to their autonomy and would fight to keep them - in parliament, or when that failed, by force of arms. However, a ruler who wanted to centralize the state paid little heed to such complaints."
 republic.003.t:1 "$PROVINCECAPITAL$ demands rights"
 republic.003.d:1 "The city of $PROVINCECAPITAL$ is arguing that its wealth and influence in $COUNTRY$ entitles it to a degree of autonomy that it is not currently receiving from us. A delegation of its leading citizens have arrived in $CAPITAL_CITY$ to argue their case. It is clear that they will regard the $MONARCHTITLE$ as a tyrant if he refuses to agree to some autonomy, but at the same time, they are not talking about open revolt... yet."
 republic.003.a:1 "Refuse to give in to their demands."
 republic.003.b:1 "Grant them a new charter."
