Seeing this, he has decided to implement radical reforms throughout all aspects of $COUNTRY$ ... and they are starting now! Beware that this will cost a lot of our Rulers attention and a lot of money."

 westernisation.1102.desc:1 "Our country has traditionally been divided into administrative regions that were born out of history and that have little to no respect for effective governing and administration.

 westernisation.1103.title:1 "Overhaul the Recruitment Process of Government Clerks"
