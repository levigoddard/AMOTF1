It was waged between the Ottoman Empire and the Republic of Venice, the latter joined by the Holy League, a coalition of Christian states formed under the auspices of the Pope, which included Spain the Republic of Genoa, the Duchy of Savoy, the Knights Hospitaller, the Grand Duchy of Tuscany, and other Italian states.\n\nThe war, the pre-eminent episode of Sultan Selim II's reign, began with the Ottoman invasion of the Venetian-held island of Cyprus. The capital Nicosia and several other towns fell quickly to the considerably superior Ottoman army, leaving only Famagusta in Venetian hands. Christian reinforcements were delayed, and Famagusta eventually fell in August 1571 after a siege of 11 months. Two months later, at the Battle of Lepanto, the united Christian fleet destroyed the Ottoman fleet, but was unable to take advantage of this victory.

The Ottoman aim was to resume the advance in central Europe, conquer Vienna and subdue Austria. However, the Habsburg army under Raimondo Montecuccoli succeeded in halting the Ottoman army on its way to Vienna in the Battle of Saint Gotthard and destroy it, while another Austrian army won another victory at Léva. Despite these serious Ottoman defeats, the war ended for them with the rather favourable Peace of Vasvár.\n\nIn the summer of 1663, an Ottoman army of more than 100,000 strong under Grand Vizier Köprülü Fazıl Ahmed entered Habsburg Hungary and in September conquered the town of Érsekújvár. The Habsburg commander Montecuccoli had only his 12,000 men and the 15,000 Hungarian-Croatian troops of Nikola Zrinski to oppose the Turks. Emperor Leopold I summoned the Imperial Diet in January 1663, to ask the German and European Kings for help, with success. An army of 30,000 Bavarian, Brandenburg and Saxon troops was raised. Even arch-enemy Louis XIV of France sent an army corps of 6,000 under Jean de Coligny-Saligny in support."

Though the victories accrued by the Russian Empire were substantial, they gained far less territory than otherwise would be expected. The reason for this was the complex struggle within the European diplomatic system for a balance of power that was acceptable to other European leading states, rather than Russian hegemony.

This policy escalated the harassment of religious minorities since the dragonnades created in 1681 in order to intimidate Huguenots into converting to Catholicism.

As a result of this traffic, the city had suffered from episodic plague outbreaks since the first wave of black death in the fourteenth century. The city was crowded and densely built.

The disease raged through Andalucía, in addition to sweeping the north into Catalonia and Aragon.\n\nIn Seville, quarantine measures were evaded, ignored, unproposed or unenforced. . The results were devastating. The city of Seville and its rural districts were thought to have lost 150,000 people— starting with a total population of 600,000. Altogether Spain was thought to have lost 500,000 people, out of a population of slightly fewer than 10,000,000, or nearly 5% of its entire population.\n\nThis was the greatest, but not the only, plague of 17th century Spain."

Although sanitation was a constant problem, the city had gone over a dozen years without an epidemic and many contemporary Londoners were unconcerned about plague.

In this improved climate it was possible to undertake measures of sweeping reform.\n\nThe aristocracy found in Gustavus a king favourable to their interests. He enlisted the nobility in the service of the state and thus provided them with numerous economic benefits. It was one of the healthiest features of Swedish society during this period that the nobility served the state, prepared to sacrifice even its privileges in the interests of the country.\n\nThe first decade of the reign, therefore, saw the creation of the Supreme Court and the establishment of the Treasury and the Chancery as permanent administrative boards and by the end of the reign an Admiralty and a War Office had been created. The Form of Government of 1634 summed up these reforms in a general statute giving Sweden a central administration more modern and efficient than that of any other European country.\n\nGustavus’s creation of the Gymnasia in the 1620s gave Sweden, for the first time, an effective provision for secondary education. He also promoted the Swedish economy through immigration and the infusion of foreign capital.

They reached the mouth of the Arkansas River, and then returned upstream, having learned that the great river ran toward the Gulf of Mexico, not toward the Pacific Ocean as they had presumed.\n\nIn 1699, fort Maurepas was constructed under direction of French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville."

The most successful group of them operated at sea, and so were called Watergeuzen, sea beggars. In the Eighty Years War, the Capture of Brielle by the Watergeuzen in 1572 provided the first foothold on land for the rebels, who would conquer the northern Netherlands and establish an independent Dutch Republic. They can be considered either as privateers or pirates, depending on the circumstances or motivations.\n\nIn 1569 William of Orange, who had now openly placed himself at the head of the party of revolt, granted letters of marque to a number of vessels manned by crews of desperadoes drawn from all nationalities. Eighteen ships received letters of marque, which were equipped by Louis of Nassau in the French Huguenot port of La Rochelle, which they continued to use as a base. By the end of 1569, already 84 Sea Beggars ships were in action."

flavor_Historical_Wars_event.1200.desc:1 "The city of Buenos Aires was founded twice. It was first founded in 1536 by an expedition led by the Spaniard Pedro de Mendoza, who named it Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Aire. He was made the first governor-general of the Río de la Plata region. That settlement soon fell victim to local Indians and to deficient supplies, and the survivors had to retreat up the river to the fortified settlement of Asunción. Nearly 50 years later Juan de Garay led a more substantial expedition back to the site, and there, at the mouth of the Riachuelo River, he refounded the city, which he called Ciudad de Trinidad in 1580. Huge tracts of land in the environs of the city were granted to members of the expedition, and they began immediately to harvest the pastoral animals that had multiplied since being left by the original party.\n\nFor nearly two centuries Buenos Aires grew at a modest pace. It was a reasonably good port, but it suffered from the rigid organization of the Spanish empire in America, under which only selected ports could be used for trade.\n\nThe vast distance separating Buenos Aires from other centres of population in the viceroyalty left the city with only sporadic contact with the administrative authority of the crown. Gradually, the city evolved its own way of life, based on extensive ranching and contraband trade."

By July, the outbreak remained circumscribed around Mexico City. Up to this point, the disease had caused relatively few cases and few deaths. During September of 1576, the peak of the rainy season, cocoliztli literally exploded, extending from central Mexico to Sonora and Guatemala in only few weeks.\n\nThe mortality increased dramatically everywhere, even in places where cocoliztli had just arrived. The highest death rate occurred from September 1576 to March 1577, after which mortality stabilized. In small towns, 20, 40 or more persons died daily, in larger towns, hundreds perished every day.\n\nThe demographic impact of the epidemic was immense. Second-hand contemporaneous estimates based on the 1570 and 1579–1580 censuses indicated that from the four million inhabitants that lived in México before the outbreak, two million died."

The King was also unpopular for imposing high taxes on the peasantry. Furthermore, German and Danish nobles and commoners held most Swedish castles and this provoked the native Swedish nobles.\n\nThe war started in January 1521 when Gustav Vasa was appointed hövitsman (commander) over Dalarna by representatives of the population in the northern part of the province. After Gustav Vasa sacked the copper mine of Kopparberg and the town of Västerås, more men joined his army. In 1522, the Hanseatic city of Lübeck allied with the Swedish rebels. After the capture of Stockholm in June 1523, the rebels effectively controlled Sweden, and on 6 June Gustav Vasa was elected King of Sweden in the town of Strängnäs."

The disease became known as Cocoliztli by the native Aztecs, and had devastating effects on the area’s demography, particularly for the indigenous people. Based on the death toll, this outbreak is often referred to as the worst disease epidemic in the history of Mexico. \n\nColonial accounts detailing the Outbreak of 1545–1548 indicate that nose bleeding, jaundice, and severe fevers were the most frequently reported symptoms. Around 800,000 died in the Valley of Mexico, which led to the widespread abandonment of many indigenous sites in the area. Estimates for the entire number of human lives lost during this epidemic have ranged from 5 to 15 million people, around 80% of Mexico’s native population.\n\nThe effects of the outbreak extended beyond just a loss in terms of population. The lack of indigenous labor led to a sizeable food shortage, which affected both the natives and Spanish. By 1545, the use of the encomienda system, in which the Spanish crown rewarded conquistadors with lands and the right extract labor from the native people, was rapidly declining in Mexico.\n\nThe pathogen was present in Europe over 300 years before the epidemics in Mexico and was likely transported to the New World, where it thrived."

Plague-carrying rat fleas soon spread across the city, sparking an epidemic.\n\ndied by the thousands, and the piles of bodies on the streets grew so large that convicts were conscripted to dispose of them. In nearby Provence, plague walls were even built to try to and contain the infection, but it still spilled over into southern France before finally disappearing in 1722.

At its peak in September 1665, some 8,000 people were dying each week. The wealthy fled to the countryside, leaving the poor as the plague’s main victims.\n\nAs the sickness spread, London’s authorities tried to contain the infected by quarantining them in their homes, which were marked with a red cross.

Over the next two years, the plague snaked its way across the countryside, striking the major cities of Verona, Milan, Venice, and Florence. In Milan and Venice, city authorities quarantined the sick in pesthouses and burned their clothes and possessions to prevent the spread of infection. The Venetians even banished some of their plague victims to a pair of islands in a nearby lagoon. \n\nThese harsh measures may have helped contain the scourge, but it still killed some 280,000 people, including over half the residents of Verona.

For more than two centuries, they would retain complete civilian and military authority over the area, up to the abolition of the Military Frontier in 1881.\n\nThe inhabitants of the area were known as the Grenzer, or Frontiersmen. They were colonists, mostly ethnic Serbs, Croats and Germans, who undertook to defend the Monarchy in return for their land-grants and religious freedom. The military regiments formed by the settlers had a vested reason to stand and fight and were familiar with local terrain and conditions. They soon gained a formidable military reputation.\n\nWith this feature enabled, Austria will grant land to slavic tribes, who in return for autonomy and religious freedom, protect the borders against incursions from the Ottoman empire."

Under her reign, Russia was revitalized; it grew larger and stronger, and was recognised as one of the great powers of Europe.\n\nIn her accession to power and her rule of the empire, Catherine often relied on her noble favourites, most notably Grigory Orlov and Grigory Potemkin. Assisted by highly successful generals such as Alexander Suvorov and Pyotr Rumyantsev, and admirals such as Fyodor Ushakov, she governed at a time when the Russian Empire was expanding rapidly by conquest and diplomacy. In the south, the Crimean Khanate was crushed following victories over the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish wars, and Russia colonised the territories of Novorossiya along the coasts of the Black and Azov Seas. In the west, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, ruled by Catherine's former lover, king Stanisław August Poniatowski, was eventually partitioned, with the Russian Empire gaining the largest share. In the east, Russia started to colonise Alaska, establishing Russian America.\nThe period of Catherine the Great's rule, the Catherinian Era, is considered the Golden Age of Russia."

This culminated in the 17th century in the dominance of Sweden as the major producer of copper. It satisfied two thirds of Europe's copper consumption in the 17th century and helped fund many of Sweden's wars during that time. It was referred to as the nation's treasury and a copper backed currency was introduced as the supply and price of silver was constantly changing.\n\nCopper was used in roofing, Renaissance sculpture, plating and sheathing and was in high demand throughout Europe.\n\nSweden can mine and build up a copper supply that other european countries can choose to buy.

As king, William resolved the issues that were holding back the English economy. He instituted policies friendly to merchant interests such as the establishment of the Bank of England, the creation of the national debt, and resolution of the Currency Crisis, which had impeded commerce through a lack of specie.\n\nAdditionally, the crown began to assertively advocate for English commercial interests and broke up the large state sponsored enterprises, which advanced the emerging New London Merchants.\n\nThese developments were significant because they allowed England to become the world's leading economy and largest imperial power in the modern era.\n\nThe resulting economic integration and military co-operation between the English and Dutch navies shifted the dominance in world trade from the Dutch Republic to England, as the main Dutch trading and banking houses moved much of their activity from Amsterdam to London."

It ended with the Commonwealth withdrawing its claims on Moldavia. Traditionally, Moldavia had been a subject of the Kingdom of Poland, and later the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. As the Ottoman influence grew in the 16th century, they had become more and more interested in the region. From the end of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century, the magnates of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth intervened in the affairs of Moldavia, which the Ottoman Empire considered within its sphere of influence. Additionally, the Ottomans were aggravated by the constant raids of Cossacks, then nominally subjects of the Commonwealth, across the border into Ottoman territories. Another reason causing the war was the recent outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, and the request of support from the Protestant rebel leaders in Bohemia."

Small military engagements produced mixed results for both sides, but the surrender of the main Russian force in February 1634 led to the Treaty of Polyanovka. Russia accepted Polish–Lithuanian control over the Smolensk region, which lasted for another 20 years. In 1632, Sigismund III Vasa, the king of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania, died. Although the Commonwealth nobility quickly elected Sigismund's son Władysław IV Vasa as their new ruler, Poland's neighbours, expecting delays in the electoral process, tested the Commonwealth's perceived weakness. Swedish king Gustav II Adolph sent envoys to Russia and the Ottoman Empire to propose an alliance and war against the Commonwealth.\n\nThe Commonwealth was not ready for war. In 1631, the royal army numbered barely 3,000 men. The Smolensk garrison was about 500 strong, and most garrisons in the border area were composed not of regular or mercenary soldiers but of 100 to 200 local volunteers. Aware that Russia was preparing for war, in the spring of 1632 the Sejm voted to increase the army size."

Other causes were the The English Navigation Acts and Sweden's effort to remove the Dutch from the market by attempting to buy grain surpluses.\n\nIn 1710, when hostility between Denmark and Sweden began, trade through the Sound became inactive. In 1721, Sweden’s Age of Greatness came to an end and trade was restored from the Baltic Sea through the Sound.

Sugar cane was best grown on relatively flat land that was near the coast, where the soil was naturally yellow and fertile.\n\nAs the European powers continued to colonize the Caribbean islands, they quickly urged local growers to change their main crops from cotton and tobacco to sugar cane. With depressed prices of cotton and tobacco, mainly due to stiff competition from the North American colonies, the farmers switched, leading to a boom in the Caribbean economies. \n\nSugar was quickly snapped up by the Europeans, who used it in cakes and to sweeten tea.\n\nThe sugar trade was taxed heavily and became a major source of revenue for the colonial powers. The more colonies in the caribbean, the greater the revenue.\n\nThis optional feature introduces a series of events related to the Caribbean sugar trade to make the region more worthwhile to colonize and emphasize its historical importance."

Consumed with the various wars in Europe, the mother countries provided few further military reinforcements to their colonies, so the colonial governors of the Caribbean increasingly made use of buccaneers as mercenaries and privateers to guard their colonies or carry the fight to their mother country's current enemy. \n\nSurprisingly not, these undisciplined and greedy dogs of war often proved difficult for their sponsors to control.\n\nBy enabling this feature, pirates may attack inadequately defended colonies in the caribbean.

The northern Protestant states, angered by the violation of their rights to choose that had been granted in the Peace of Augsburg, banded together to form the Protestant Union.\n\nThese events caused widespread fears throughout northern and central Europe, and triggered the Protestant Bohemians living in the then relatively loose dominion of Habsburg Austria to revolt against their nominal ruler.\n\nThe Empire soon crushed this perceived rebellion, executing leading Czech aristocrats shortly after.

In 1646, when Charles II was just twelve years old, his father was defeated by Oliver Cromwell’s Parliamentary forces. A long and complicated trial unfolded as Cromwell and Parliament deliberated the best way to deal with the captured King.

Nevertheless, the king was beheaded.\n\nCharles II fled to Scotland following his father’s death, knowing that staying in England under Cromwell’s rule would be dangerous. There he remained until Cromwell invaded Scotland, forcing him to leave the British isles for mainland Europe.

Cromwell agonised for six weeks over the offer. He was attracted by the prospect of stability it held out, but in a speech on 13 April 1657 he made clear that God's providence had spoken against the office of king. Instead, Cromwell was ceremonially re-installed as Lord Protector at Westminster Hall, sitting upon King Edward's Chair which was specially moved from Westminster Abbey for the occasion.\n\nCromwell faced challenges in foreign policy during his reign. The First Anglo-Dutch War which had broken out in 1652, against the Dutch Republic, was eventually won by Admiral Robert Blake in 1654. Having negotiated peace with the Dutch, Cromwell then proceeded to engage the Spanish in warfare, through his Western Design. This involved secret preparations for an attack on the Spanish colonies in the Caribbean. This resulted in the invasion of Jamaica, which then became an English colony. The Lord Protector became aware of the contribution the Jewish community made to the economic success of Holland, now England's leading commercial rival. In the hopes of that they would help speed up the recovery of the country after the disruption of the Civil Wars, private worship of non-puritans was toleratedm encouraging Jews to return to England, 350 years after their banishment by Edward I.\n\n"

Portugal, for its part, felt no need to take Spanish territory in order to win, and it too was willing to make the war a defensive contest. \n\nThe war was also expensive. In the 1650s, there were over 20,000 Spanish troops in Extremadura alone, compared to 27,000 in Flanders. Portugal was able to finance its war effort because of its ability to tax the spice trade with Asia and the sugar trade from Brazil, and it received some support from the European opponents of Spain, particularly France and England. \n\nThe revolution of 1640 ended the 60-year rule of Portugal by the Spanish Habsburgs. \n\nWar goal - historical peace treaty: \n\nPortugal: Capture capital of Spain or achieve 25% warscore."

The King was also unpopular for imposing high taxes on the peasantry. Furthermore, German and Danish nobles and commoners held most Swedish castles and this provoked the native Swedish nobles.\n\nThe war started in January 1521 when Gustav Vasa was appointed hövitsman (commander) over Dalarna by representatives of the population in the northern part of the province. After Gustav Vasa sacked the copper mine of Kopparberg and the town of Västerås, more men joined his army. In 1522, the Hanseatic city of Lübeck allied with the Swedish rebels. After the capture of Stockholm in June 1523, the rebels effectively controlled Sweden, and on 6 June Gustav Vasa was elected King of Sweden in the town of Strängnäs."

Beginning in 1602, the conflict primarily involved the Dutch companies invading Portuguese colonies in the Americas, Africa, India and the Far East. The war can be thought of as an extension of the Eighty Years War being fought in Europe at the time between Spain and the Netherlands, as Portugal was in a dynastic union with the Spanish Crown after the War of the Portuguese Succession, for most of the conflict. However, the conflict had little to do with the war in Europe and served mainly as a way for the Dutch to gain an overseas empire and control trade at the cost of the Portuguese.

For a time, the merchants of the Netherlands were content to accept this and buy all of their spice in Lisbon, Portugal, as they could still make a decent profit by reselling it throughout Europe. However, in the 1590s Spain, which was at war with the Netherlands, was in a dynastic union with Portugal, thus making continued trade practically impossible. This was intolerable to the Dutch who would have been glad to circumvent the Portuguese monopoly and go straight to Indonesia, but the sailing directions needed in order to reach Indonesia were jealously guarded by the Portuguese.\n\nHowever, in 1592 the cartographer Petrus Plancius published a series of charts showing, in exact detail, the route to the Indies. Soon after these charts were published, three Amsterdam merchants began meeting in secret, plotting an expedition to Indonesia. One of the first things these merchants did was to send Cornelis de Houtman, to Lisbon, posing as a merchant. His job was to confirm Plancius' charts and see if he could find any more information on the East Indies. The Amsterdam merchants now had all of the information they needed, and they set about raising capital to fund the expedition and were able to raise 290,000 guilders, and used it to build and equip four ships: the Mauritius, Amsterdam, Hollandia, and the Duifje.\n\nThe fleet sailed from the port of Texel on April 2, 1595 and reached Bantam , Java but were received poorly due to the machinations of the Portuguese, who persuaded the Bantamese to raise their prices to absurdly high levels. De Houtman, by this time, was the de facto leader of the expedition, most of his opponents having been either killed or disgraced by this time.\n\nAlthough the expedition did not bring back as much as expected spice prices had become so inflated that the expedition was still profitable. All in all, the voyage suffered from bad leadership, but was still instrumental in opening up the East Indies to the Dutch."

The company behind the first expedition, the Far-distance Company, and the recently established New Company for Voyages to East India joined forces and between them managed to raise nearly 800,000 guilders, the most money that had ever been raised in the Netherlands for a private venture.\n\nAdmiral Jacob van Neck was chosen as the leader, with Vice-Admiral Wybrand van Warwyck and arctic explorer Jacob van Heemskerck as his lieutenants.\n\nOn May 1, 1598, the fleet sailed from Texel. The fleet made excellent time at first, rounding the Cape of Good Hope in only three months. However, soon after reaching the Cape the fleet was hit by heavy storms, and was split into two parts. Van Neck with three ships quickly recovered and landed on the East coast of Madagascar in order to replenish supplies, while the other ships under Warwyck could not land on Madagascar due to the storm. After seven months of sailing in all, Van Neck and his three ships reached the trading city of Bantam on November 25. The Bantamese received the Dutch eagerly, because they had recently fought with the Portuguese and destroyed three of their ships, so they hoped to gain protection from any vengeful Portuguese fleets by forging an alliance with Van Neck. Within one month he had filled all three ships full of spices.\n\nThe other ships, meanwhile, landed on the island of Do Cerne, which they renamed Mauritius in honor of Maurice of Nassau. They left a rooster and seven hens on the island, and also planted many seeds, including some orange and lemon trees. They then sailed for Bantam, which they reached on December 30.\n\nVan Neck quickly filled one of the four ships brought by Warwyck with spice and then sailed for home with it and the other three that he had already filled. He reached Amsterdam in July 1599, the journey having taken half as long as the de Houtman expedition."

Over the course of the wars, particularly in the 16th century, the Muscovites were able to expand their domain westwards, taking control of many principalities.\n\nIn 1506 the ruler of Muscowy advanced his bid for the Polish throne, but Polish nobles chose Sigismund I the Old, who was crowned both as King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania.
