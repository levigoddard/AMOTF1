Hello! If you happen to be reading this, you must be wanting to change the colour of Byzantium that I adjusted in 1.1.4! If so, these are the steps you need to do:

1. Navigate into the common/countries/ folder in this mod file. Open up the ByzantineEmpire.txt
2. Put a square (#), in front of "color = { 102 2 60 }"
3. Remove the square that is in front of "color = { 121 28 144 }"

This changes your country colour from the Tyrian Purple into a more purplish purple.

If you wish to also adjust the country flag to the old purple, this is what you do:

1. Navigate into the gfx/flags/ folder in this mod file. You will find two files "old_BYZ.tga" and "BYZ.tga"
2. Either delete or temporaily rename the "BYZ.tga" file
3. Rename the "old_BYZ.tga" to "BYZ.tga"

This changes your country flag from using the Tyrian Purple into the original purplish one.

That's it! Happy conquering!
