 neo_catalan_legacy_desc: "Our land was established by Catalan Crusaders fleeing from the Holy Land. After all these years under Roman yoke, sometimes you pick the lesser of two evils, no?"
 neo_religious_indifference: "Religious Indifference"
 neo_religious_indifference_desc: "Our very nature of a Crusader State, where the ruling class and the peasantry have very different traditions, can cause religious unrest between the two classes. It is necessary to understand that the very survival of our state depends on religious harmony."
 neo_rolling_hills_thessaly: "Rolling Hills of Thessaly"
 neo_rolling_hills_thessaly_desc: "Thessaly is the region between Athens and Saloniki, the valley between the two mountains. It is home to some of the world's best farmland and orchards."
 neo_crusader_lords: "Crusader Lords"
 neo_crusader_lords_desc: "An Englishman's home is his castle, and the home of a Neopatras is equally impenetrable. The hilly grassland of Thessaly is easily defensible against Roman or Osman alike."
 neo_byzantine_bureaucracy: "Byzantine Bureaucracy"
 neo_byzantine_bureaucracy_desc: "The lands of the Eastern Roman Empire has been for too long... eastern. Let us govern the land using more Western practices, and thus increase our share of tax and trade."
 neo_catalan_company: "The Catalan Company"
 neo_catalan_company_desc: "The Catalan Company was a group of mercenaries fighting in the Crusades. Our kin have long been hired for such purposes, and who is to say we couldn't call in a favour every now and again?"
 neo_seafaring_people: "Seafaring People"

 revoke_knightly_order_autonomy_desc:0 "Through the dawn of the Age of Absolutism, countries start shifting away from religious crusades and feudalism to absolute rulers and standing armies. We should join in this shift and move away from our very feudal structure by bringing our Knightly Orders... closer, to us."

 from_papal_afflatus: "From Papal Afflatus"
 from_papal_afflatus_desc: "We have come here to save the holiest of places from heathen hands, inspired by our Pope and his wise words. If someone obeyed His Holiness to such degree, how can he and his heirs not be the most important duke in Christian world?"
 another_crusaders_kings: "Another Crusaders' Kings"
 another_crusaders_kings_desc: "Great names like Godfrey Bouillion or Guy de Lusignan are, unfortunately, relics of the past; times are changing, and we need neither feudal scrambles nor brave knights in shining armors, which are so easy to shoot through! We will end with old order, but never overlook a need for a large number of sons!"
 outremer_trade: "Outremer Trade"
 outremer_trade_desc: "Silk! Spices! Fruits, pistachios, nuts, almonds, dates! Vanillas, mmh, yes, sweet vanillas! WINE! By God almighty, everything so fresh, so tasty, so shiny, and beautiful! Trade with Venice and Genoa is profitable enough that if I would give one florin to a beggar for each ten thousand florins some merchant gains, he would be rich by midnight! Let us profit from this, for there is no other way to India than through the Levant! Those foolish Portuguese, how can they think they can sail south and find passage there? Nay, nay, there are monsters there! Silly Iberians..."
 dry_wells: "Dry Wells"
 dry_wells_desc: "When you reach the countryside, everything is dry as sand or my head this morning. Often even wells in abandoned villages are dry, and pity on who encounters such a well during his march. It is critical for us to secure water supplies and be ready for future campaigns against the heathens."
 crusader_marines: "Crusader Marines"
 crusader_marines_desc: "The Italian mercenary fleets we used to hire to reach Palestine were often ill suited for fight. We should create our own armadas and embark them with the greatest warriors mankind has ever seen. Those will be Crusader Marines, and they shall know no fear!"
 ordos_militants: "Ordos Militants"
 ordos_militants_desc: "He who has piety in his heart, sword in his hand, blood in his veins, dust on his chest, and a tiny swath of land should join our militant order and sacrifice his life for greater good, fighting heathen and heretic. One would best do this job by becoming an officer, inspiring and introducing his men to strict monastic discipline. If we manage to get a whole cadre of these officers, our armies would become unstoppable."
 brothers_in_faith: "Brothers in Faith"
 brothers_in_faith_desc: "Everyone wants to be saved, but not everyone can or wants go to Holy Land and fight. So, through giving us gifts, military backup or filthy lucre they get what they want. A strong feeling of importance that we are guardians of our Lord's footsteps creates a worldwide reputation of us as honest (hah!), proud men, which is beneficial for our diplomatic look, not only among grateful brothers in faith."
